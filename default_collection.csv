2404.05826v1,Decade-long Utilization Patterns of ICSE Technical Papers and Associated  Artifacts,Sharif Ahmed; Rey Ortiz; Nasir U. Eisty,"Context: Annually, ICSE acknowledges a range of papers, a subset of which are paired with research artifacts such as source code, datasets, and supplementary materials, adhering to the Open Science Policy. However, no prior systematic inquiry dives into gauging the influence of ICSE papers using artifact attributes. Objective: We explore the mutual impact between artifacts and their associated papers presented at ICSE over ten years.  Method: We collect data on usage attributes from papers and their artifacts, conduct a statistical assessment to identify differences, and analyze the top five papers in each attribute category.  Results: There is a significant difference between paper citations and the usage of associated artifacts. While statistical analyses show no notable difference between paper citations and GitHub stars, variations exist in views and/or downloads of papers and artifacts.  Conclusion: We provide a thorough overview of ICSE's accepted papers from the last decade, emphasizing the intricate relationship between research papers and their artifacts. To enhance the assessment of artifact influence in software research, we recommend considering key attributes that may be present in one platform but not in another.",2024-04-08,2024-04-08,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05826v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05826v1,,,ICSE,2024,cs.SE,2025-09-09T07:36:32.483356

In this work, we want to use the articles published in this track as a proxy or example of the research in this field, in terms of covered topics, trends, and gaps. Also, since SEIS was originally defined with a special focus on sustainability, we want to observe the evolution of the research in this respect. We conducted a mapping study of the 123 articles published in the SEIS track and among the results identified (i) trends pertaining sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and open-source software; (ii) gaps regarding concrete interventions to solve problems (e.g., workplace discrimination, the emotional well-being of developers); and (iii) a main sustainability focus in the social dimension, while the environmental dimension is the least frequently addressed.

2502.15599v2,"Bugfix: a standard language, database schema and repository for research  on bugs and automatic program repair",Victoria Kananchuk; Ilgiz Mustafin; Bertrand Meyer,"Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a brilliant idea: when detecting a bug, also provide suggestions for correcting the program. Progress towards that goal is hindered by the absence of a common frame of reference for the multiplicity of APR ideas, methods, tools, programming languages and environments.  Bugfix is an effort at providing such a framework: a standardized set of notations, tools and interfaces, as well as a database of bugs and fixes, for use by the APR research community to try out ideas and compare results.  The most directly visible component of the Bugfix effort is the Bugfix language, a human-readable formalism making it possible to describe elements of the following kinds: a bug (described abstractly, for example the permutation of two arguments in a call); a bug example (an actual occurrence of a bug, in a specific code written in a specific programming language, and usually recorded in some repository); a fix (a particular correction of a bug, obtained for example by reversing the misplaced arguments); an application (an entity that demonstrates how a actual code example matches with a fix); a construct (the abstract description of a programming mechanism, for example a ``while'' loop, independently of its realization in a programming language; and a language (a description of how a particular programming language includes certain constructs and provides specific concrete syntax for each of them -- for example Java includes loop, assignment etc. and has a defined format for each of them).  A JSON API provides it in a form accessible to tools. Bugfix includes a repository containing a considerable amount of bugs, examples and fixes.

2412.06251v2,Fearless Unsafe. A More User-friendly Document for Unsafe Rust  Programming Base on Refined Safety Properties,Mohan Cui; Penglei Mao; Shuran Sun; Yangfan Zhou; Hui Xu,"Rust, a popular systems-level programming language, has garnered widespread attention due to its features of achieving run-time efficiency and memory safety. With an increasing number of real-world projects adopting Rust, understanding how to assist programmers in correctly writing unsafe code poses a significant challenge. Based on our observations, the current standard library has many unsafe APIs, but their descriptions are not uniform, complete, and intuitive, especially in describing safety requirements. Therefore, we advocate establishing a systematic category of safety requirements for revising those documents.  In this paper, we extended and refined our study in ICSE 2024. We defined a category of Safety Properties (22 items in total) that learned from the documents of unsafe APIs in the standard library. Then, we labeled all public unsafe APIs (438 in total) and analyzed their correlations. Based on the safety properties, we reorganized all the unsafe documents in the standard library and designed a consultation plugin into rust-analyzer as a complementary tool to assist Rust developers in writing unsafe code. To validate the practical significance, we categorized the root causes of all Rust CVEs up to 2024-01-31 (419 in total) into safety properties and further counted the real-world usage of unsafe APIs in the crates.io ecosystem.",2024-12-09,2024-12-19,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06251v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06251v2,,,ICSE,2024,cs.SE,2025-09-09T07:36:36.067895

2504.16472v2,Harden and Catch for Just-in-Time Assured LLM-Based Software Testing:  Open Research Challenges,Mark Harman; Peter O'Hearn; Shubho Sengupta,"Despite decades of research and practice in automated software testing, several fundamental concepts remain ill-defined and under-explored, yet offer enormous potential real-world impact. We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of Large Language Models for software test generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching 'Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated 'just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

Venters,"Education for sustainable development has evolved to include more constructive approaches and a better understanding of what is needed to align education with the cultural, societal, and pedagogical changes required to avoid the risks posed by an unsustainable society. This evolution aims to lead us toward viable, equitable, and sustainable futures. However, computing education, including software engineering, is not fully aligned with the current understanding of what is needed for transformational learning in light of our current challenges. This is partly because computing is primarily seen as a technical field, focused on industry needs. Until recently, sustainability was not a high priority for most businesses, including the digital sector, nor was it a prominent focus for higher education institutions and society.  Given these challenges, we aim to propose a research roadmap to integrate sustainability principles and essential skills into the crowded computing curriculum, nurturing future software engineering professionals with a sustainability mindset. We conducted two extensive studies: a systematic review of academic literature on sustainability in computing education and a survey of industry professionals on their interest in sustainability and desired skills for graduates. Using insights from these studies, we identified key topics for teaching sustainability, including core sustainability principles, values and ethics, systems thinking, impact measurement, soft skills, business value, legal standards, and advocacy. Based on these findings, we will develop recommendations for future computing education programs that emphasise sustainability.

2112.07303v3,MMO: Meta Multi-Objectivization for Software Configuration Tuning,Pengzhou Chen; Tao Chen; Miqing Li,"Software configuration tuning is essential for optimizing a given performance objective (e.g., minimizing latency). Yet, due to the software's intrinsically complex configuration landscape and expensive measurement, there has been a rather mild success, particularly in preventing the search from being trapped in local optima. To address this issue, in this paper we take a different perspective. Instead of focusing on improving the optimizer, we work on the level of optimization model and propose a meta multi-objectivization (MMO) model that considers an auxiliary performance objective (e.g., throughput in addition to latency). What makes this model distinct is that we do not optimize the auxiliary performance objective, but rather use it to make similarly-performing while different configurations less comparable (i.e. Pareto nondominated to each other), thus preventing the search from being trapped in local optima. Importantly, by designing a new normalization method, we show how to effectively use the MMO model without worrying about its weight -- the only yet highly sensitive parameter that can affect its effectiveness. Experiments on 22 cases from 11 real-world software systems/environments confirm that our MMO model with the new normalization performs better than its state-of-the-art single-objective counterparts on 82% cases while achieving up to 2.09x speedup. For 68% of the cases, the new normalization also enables the MMO model to outperform the instance when using it with the normalization from our prior FSE work under pre-tuned best weights, saving a great amount of resources which would be otherwise necessary to find a good weight. We also demonstrate that the MMO model with the new normalization can consolidate recent model-based tuning tools on 68% of the cases with up to 1.22x speedup in general.",2021-12-14,2024-03-15,"cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.DC",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07303v3,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07303v3,,,FSE,2024,cs.SE,2025-09-09T07:36:43.467122
2111.02038v5,Fair-SSL: Building fair ML Software with less data,Joymallya Chakraborty; Suvodeep Majumder; Huy Tu,"Ethical bias in machine learning models has become a matter of concern in the software engineering community. Most of the prior software engineering works concentrated on finding ethical bias in models rather than fixing it. After finding bias, the next step is mitigation. Prior researchers mainly tried to use supervised approaches to achieve fairness. However, in the real world, getting data with trustworthy ground truth is challenging and also ground truth can contain human bias. Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning technique where, incrementally, labeled data is used to generate pseudo-labels for the rest of the data (and then all that data is used for model training). In this work, we apply four popular semi-supervised techniques as pseudo-labelers to create fair classification models. Our framework, Fair-SSL, takes a very small amount (10%) of labeled data as input and generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. We then synthetically generate new data points to balance the training data based on class and protected attribute as proposed by Chakraborty et al. in FSE 2021. Finally, the classification model is trained on the balanced pseudo-labeled data and validated on test data. After experimenting on ten datasets and three learners, we find that Fair-SSL achieves similar performance as three state-of-the-art bias mitigation algorithms. That said, the clear advantage of Fair-SSL is that it requires only 10% of the labeled training data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SE work where semi-supervised techniques are used to fight against ethical bias in SE ML models.",2021-11-03,2022-03-22,"cs.SE, cs.LG",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.02038v5,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02038v5,10.1145/3524491.3527305,"International Workshop on Equitable Data and Technology (FairWare

Such systems are realizable thanks in large part to major advances in perception and decision-making techniques, which in turn have been propelled forward by modern machine learning tools. However, these newer forms of intelligent autonomy raise questions about when/how communication of the operational intent and assessments of actual vs. supposed capabilities of autonomous agents impact overall performance. This symposium examines the possibilities for enabling intelligent autonomous systems to self-assess and communicate their ability to effectively execute assigned tasks, as well as reason about the overall limits of their competencies and maintain operability within those limits.

As artificial intelligence tools (AI) are rapidly deployed, it is therefore crucial to understand how they will impact climate action. On the one hand, AI can support applications in climate change mitigation (reducing or preventing greenhouse gas emissions), adaptation (preparing for the effects of a changing climate), and climate science. These applications have implications in areas ranging as widely as energy, agriculture, and finance. At the same time, AI is used in many ways that hinder climate action (e.g., by accelerating the use of greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels). In addition, AI technologies have a carbon and energy footprint themselves.

For example, how should a robot convey predicted ability on a new task? How should it report performance on a task that was just completed? How should a robot adapt its proficiency criteria based on human intentions and values?  Communities in AI, robotics, HRI, and cognitive science have addressed related questions, but there are no agreed upon standards for evaluating proficiency and intent-based interactions. This is a pressing challenge for human-robot interaction for a variety of reasons. Prior work has shown that a robot that can assess its performance can alter human perception of the robot and decisions on control allocation. There is also significant evidence in robotics that accurately setting human expectations is critical, especially when proficiency is below human expectations. Moreover, proficiency assessment depends on context and intent, and a human teammate might increase or decrease performance standards, adapt tolerance for risk and uncertainty, demand predictive assessments that affect attention allocation, or otherwise reassess or adapt intent.",2022-04-05,2022-04-05,"cs.AI, cs.RO",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02437v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02437v1,,,AAAI,2024,cs.AI,2025-09-09T07:36:47.022942

Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery patterns.

2505.01647v1,Scalable Speed-ups for the SMS-EMOA from a Simple Aging Strategy,Mingfeng Li; Weijie Zheng; Benjamin Doerr,"Different from single-objective evolutionary algorithms, where non-elitism is an established concept, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms almost always select the next population in a greedy fashion. In the only notable exception, Bian, Zhou, Li, and Qian (IJCAI 2023) proposed a stochastic selection mechanism for the SMS-EMOA and proved that it can speed up computing the Pareto front of the bi-objective jump benchmark with problem size $n$ and gap parameter $k$ by a factor of $\max\{1,2^{k/4}/n\}$. While this constitutes the first proven speed-up from non-elitist selection, suggesting a very interesting research direction, it has to be noted that a true speed-up only occurs for $k \ge 4\log_2(n)$, where the runtime is super-polynomial, and that the advantage reduces for larger numbers of objectives as shown in a later work. In this work, we propose a different non-elitist selection mechanism based on aging, which exempts individuals younger than a certain age from a possible removal. This remedies the two shortcomings of stochastic selection: We prove a speed-up by a factor of $\max\{1,\Theta(k)^{k-1}\}$, regardless of the number of objectives. In particular, a positive speed-up can already be observed for constant $k$, the only setting for which polynomial runtimes can be witnessed. Overall, this result supports the use of non-elitist selection schemes, but suggests that aging-based mechanisms can be considerably more powerful than stochastic selection mechanisms.",2025-05-03,2025-05-03,"cs.NE, cs.AI",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01647v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01647v1,,,IJCAI,2024,cs.AI,2025-09-09T07:36:54.050524

However, they face the loss of statistical information due to a lack of consideration for class-wise data. In this paper, from the perspective of leveraging precise class-wise information for model pruning, we utilize structured lasso with guidance from Information Bottleneck theory. Our approach ensures that statistical information is retained during the pruning process. With these techniques, we introduce two innovative adaptive network pruning schemes: sparse graph-structured lasso pruning with Information Bottleneck (\textbf{sGLP-IB}) and sparse tree-guided lasso pruning with Information Bottleneck (\textbf{sTLP-IB}). The key aspect is pruning model filters using sGLP-IB and sTLP-IB to better capture class-wise relatedness. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods, our approaches demonstrate superior performance across three datasets and six model architectures in extensive experiments. For instance, using the VGG16 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we achieve a parameter reduction of 85%, a decrease in FLOPs by 61%, and maintain an accuracy of 94.10% (0.14% higher than the original model); we reduce the parameters by 55% with the accuracy at 76.12% using the ResNet architecture on ImageNet (only drops 0.03%).

Recently, Zhou~et~al.~(IJCAI,~2024) analyzed the complexity of deciding whether graphs containing a mixture of goods and chores admit EFX orientations, and conjectured that deciding whether graphs containing only chores admit EFX orientations is NP-complete. In this paper, we resolve this conjecture by exhibiting a polynomial-time algorithm that finds an EFX orientation of a graph containing only chores if one exists, even if the graph contains self-loops. Remarkably, our first result demonstrates a surprising separation between the case of goods and the case of chores, because deciding whether graphs containing only goods admit EFX orientations of goods was shown to be NP-complete by Christodoulou et al.~(EC,~2023).

Our findings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours and over 93% of researchers focus primarily on music from the Global North. However, around 40% of these datasets include some form of non-Western music, genres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore, approximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music generation, a method that often fails to capture the cultural nuances inherent in music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

2505.19001v2,DARTH: Declarative Recall Through Early Termination for Approximate  Nearest Neighbor Search,Manos Chatzakis; Yannis Papakonstantinou; Themis Palpanas,"Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) presents an inherent tradeoff between performance and recall (i.e., result quality). Each ANNS algorithm provides its own algorithm-dependent parameters to allow applications to influence the recall/performance tradeoff of their searches. This situation is doubly problematic. First, the application developers have to experiment with these algorithm-dependent parameters to fine-tune the parameters that produce the desired recall for each use case. This process usually takes a lot of effort. Even worse, the chosen parameters may produce good recall for some queries, but bad recall for hard queries. To solve these problems, we present DARTH, a method that uses target declarative recall. DARTH uses a novel method for providing target declarative recall on top of an ANNS index by employing an adaptive early termination strategy integrated into the search algorithm. Through a wide range of experiments, we demonstrate that DARTH effectively meets user-defined recall targets while achieving significant speedups, up to 14.6x (average: 6.8x; median: 5.7x) faster than the search without early termination for HNSW and up to 41.8x (average: 13.6x; median: 8.1x) for IVF.

Recent progress has seen the rise of declarative AI frameworks (e.g., Palimpzest, Lotus, and DocETL) to build optimized and increasingly complex pipelines, but these systems often remain accessible only to expert programmers. In this demonstration, we present PalimpChat, a chat-based interface to Palimpzest that bridges this gap by letting users create and run sophisticated AI pipelines through natural language alone. By integrating Archytas, a ReAct-based reasoning agent, and Palimpzest's suite of relational and LLM-based operators, PalimpChat provides a practical illustration of how a chat interface can make declarative AI frameworks truly accessible to non-experts.

However, there is currently no ANN method that performs well in both indexing and query answering performance, while providing rigorous theoretical guarantees for the quality of the answers. In this paper, we first design SC-score, a metric that we show follows the Pareto principle and can act as a proxy for the Euclidean distance between data points. Inspired by this, we propose a novel ANN search framework called Subspace Collision (SC), which can provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of its results. We further propose SuCo, which achieves efficient and accurate ANN search by designing a clustering-based lightweight index and query strategies for our proposed subspace collision framework. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that both the indexing and query answering performance of SuCo outperform state-of-the-art ANN methods that can provide theoretical guarantees, performing 1-2 orders of magnitude faster query answering with only up to one-tenth of the index memory footprint. Moreover, SuCo achieves top performance (best for hard datasets) even when compared to methods that do not provide theoretical guarantees.

2306.04227v1,High-Performance Caching of Homomorphic Encryption for Cloud Databases,Dongfang Zhao,"While homomorphic encryption (HE) has garnered significant research interest in cloud-based outsourced databases due to its algebraic properties over ciphertexts, the computational overhead associated with HE has hindered its widespread adoption in production database systems. Recently, a caching technique called Radix-based additive caching of homomorphic encryption (Rache) was proposed in SIGMOD'23. The primary objective of this paper is to address the performance overhead resulting from the expensive randomization process in Rache. To achieve this, we propose a novel encryption algorithm called $ASEnc$, which replaces the computationally intensive full scan of radixes with the caching of a polynomial number of radix-powers during an offline stage. This design significantly reduces the performance impact caused by randomization. Furthermore, this paper aims to extend Rache's capabilities to support floating-point numbers. To accomplish this, we introduce a new encryption algorithm named $FSEnc$, leveraging efficient constant multiplication available in state-of-the-art fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. Notably, $FSEnc$ offers the flexibility to cache the coefficients instead of the radixes themselves, which may result in a large number of cached ciphertexts. However, we manage this efficiently by streaming the dynamically cached ciphertexts through a vector of circular buffers. We demonstrate that both encryption algorithms guarantee semantic security (IND-CPA). To validate their performance, we implement both algorithms as loadable functions in MySQL 8.0 and deploy the system prototype on a 96-core server hosted in the Chameleon Cloud. Experimental results showcase that $ASEnc$ outperforms Rache by 2.3--3.3$\times$, while $FSEnc$ surpasses the state-of-the-art floating-point FHE CKKS by 1.8--5.6$\times$.",2023-06-07,2023-06-07,"cs.CR, cs.DB",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04227v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04227v1,,,SIGMOD,2024,cs.DB,2025-09-09T07:37:01.662346
2304.08264v1,Dumpy: A Compact and Adaptive Index for Large Data Series Collections,Zeyu Wang; Qitong Wang; Peng Wang; Themis Palpanas; Wei Wang,"Data series indexes are necessary for managing and analyzing the increasing amounts of data series collections that are nowadays available. These indexes support both exact and approximate similarity search, with approximate search providing high-quality results within milliseconds, which makes it very attractive for certain modern applications. Reducing the pre-processing (i.e., index building) time and improving the accuracy of search results are two major challenges. DSTree and the iSAX index family are state-of-the-art solutions for this problem. However, DSTree suffers from long index building times, while iSAX suffers from low search accuracy. In this paper, we identify two problems of the iSAX index family that adversely affect the overall performance. First, we observe the presence of a proximity-compactness trade-off related to the index structure design (i.e., the node fanout degree), significantly limiting the efficiency and accuracy of the resulting index. Second, a skewed data distribution will negatively affect the performance of iSAX. To overcome these problems, we propose Dumpy, an index that employs a novel multi-ary data structure with an adaptive node splitting algorithm and an efficient building workflow. Furthermore, we devise Dumpy-Fuzzy as a variant of Dumpy which further improves search accuracy by proper duplication of series. Experiments with a variety of large, real datasets demonstrate that the Dumpy solutions achieve considerably better efficiency, scalability and search accuracy than its competitors.

2209.08475v3,Scaling and Load-Balancing Equi-Joins,Ahmed Metwally,"The task of joining two tables is fundamental for querying databases. In this paper, we focus on the equi-join problem, where a pair of records from the two joined tables are part of the join results if equality holds between their values in the join column(s). While this is a tractable problem when the number of records in the joined tables is relatively small, it becomes very challenging as the table sizes increase, especially if hot keys (join column values with a large number of records) exist in both joined tables.  This paper, an extended version of [metwally-SIGMOD-2022], proposes Adaptive-Multistage-Join (AM-Join) for scalable and fast equi-joins in distributed shared-nothing architectures. AM-Join utilizes (a) Tree-Join, a proposed novel algorithm that scales well when the joined tables share hot keys, and (b) Broadcast-Join, the known fastest when joining keys that are hot in only one table.  Unlike the state-of-the-art algorithms, AM-Join (a) holistically solves the join-skew problem by achieving load balancing throughout the join execution, and (b) supports all outer-join variants without record deduplication or custom table partitioning. For the fastest AM-Join outer-join performance, we propose the Index-Broadcast-Join (IB-Join) family of algorithms for Small-Large joins, where one table fits in memory and the other can be up to orders of magnitude larger. The outer-join variants of IB-Join improves on the state-of-the-art Small-Large outer-join algorithms.  The proposed algorithms can be adopted in any shared-nothing architecture. We implemented a MapReduce version using Spark. Our evaluation shows the proposed algorithms execute significantly faster and scale to more skewed and orders-of-magnitude bigger tables when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.",2022-09-18,2025-03-13,"cs.DB, cs.DC, H.3.3; F.2.0",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08475v3,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08475v3,10.1145/3722102,"ACM Trans.

The state-of-the-art motif discovery tools still require the user to provide the motif length. Yet, in several cases, the choice of motif length is critical for their detection. Unfortunately, the obvious brute-force solution, which tests all lengths within a given range, is computationally untenable, and does not provide any support for ranking motifs at different resolutions (i.e., lengths). We demonstrate VALMOD, our scalable motif discovery algorithm that efficiently finds all motifs in a given range of lengths, and outputs a length-invariant ranking of motifs.

2402.11741v1,To Store or Not to Store: a graph theoretical approach for Dataset  Versioning,Anxin Guo; Jingwei Li; Pattara Sukprasert; Samir Khuller; Amol Deshpande; Koyel Mukherjee,"In this work, we study the cost efficient data versioning problem, where the goal is to optimize the storage and reconstruction (retrieval) costs of data versions, given a graph of datasets as nodes and edges capturing edit/delta information. One central variant we study is MinSum Retrieval (MSR) where the goal is to minimize the total retrieval costs, while keeping the storage costs bounded. This problem (along with its variants) was introduced by Bhattacherjee et al. [VLDB'15]. While such problems are frequently encountered in collaborative tools (e.g., version control systems and data analysis pipelines), to the best of our knowledge, no existing research studies the theoretical aspects of these problems.  We establish that the currently best-known heuristic, LMG, can perform arbitrarily badly in a simple worst case. Moreover, we show that it is hard to get $o(n)$-approximation for MSR on general graphs even if we relax the storage constraints by an $O(\log n)$ factor. Similar hardness results are shown for other variants. Meanwhile, we propose poly-time approximation schemes for tree-like graphs, motivated by the fact that the graphs arising in practice from typical edit operations are often not arbitrary. As version graphs typically have low treewidth, we further develop new algorithms for bounded treewidth graphs.  Furthermore, we propose two new heuristics and evaluate them empirically. First, we extend LMG by considering more potential ``moves'', to propose a new heuristic LMG-All. LMG-All consistently outperforms LMG while having comparable run time on a wide variety of datasets, i.e., version graphs. Secondly, we apply our tree algorithms on the minimum-storage arborescence of an instance, yielding algorithms that are qualitatively better than all previous heuristics for MSR, as well as for another variant BoundedMin Retrieval (BMR).",2024-02-18,2024-02-18,"cs.DS, cs.CC, cs.DB, cs.DC",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11741v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11741v1,,,VLDB,2024,cs.DB,2025-09-09T07:37:08.732158

Moreover, once a program has been generated, it is non-trivial to revisit a previous version or make changes to the program without starting the process over again.

In this proposal, we demonstrate that indeed ChatGPT can assist in data cleaning by suggesting corrections for specific cells in a data table (scenario 1). However, ChatGPT may struggle with datasets it has never encountered before (e.g., local enterprise data) or when the user requires an explanation of the source of the suggested clean values. To address these issues, we developed a retrieval-based method that complements ChatGPT's power with a user-provided data lake. The data lake is first indexed, we then retrieve the top-k relevant tuples to the user's query tuple and finally leverage ChatGPT to infer the correct value (scenario 2). Nevertheless, sharing enterprise data with ChatGPT, an externally hosted model, might not be feasible for privacy reasons. To assist with this scenario, we developed a custom RoBERTa-based foundation model that can be locally deployed. By fine-tuning it on a small number of examples, it can effectively make value inferences based on the retrieved tuples (scenario 3).

In particular, a k-regret minimizing set has the property that the regret ratio between the score of the top-1 item in Q and the score of the top-k item in P is minimized, where the score of an item is the inner product of the item's attributes with a user's weight (preference) vector. The problem is challenging because we want to find a single representative set Q whose regret ratio is small with respect to all possible user weight vectors.  We show that k-regret minimization is NP-Complete for all dimensions d >= 3. This settles an open problem from Chester et al. [VLDB 2014], and resolves the complexity status of the problem for all d: the problem is known to have polynomial-time solution for d <= 2. In addition, we propose two new approximation schemes for regret minimization, both with provable guarantees, one based on coresets and another based on hitting sets.

We observe that the two committees disagree on their accept/reject recommendations for 23% of the papers and that, consistent with the results from 2014, approximately half of the list of accepted papers would change if the review process were randomly rerun. Our analysis suggests that making the conference more selective would increase the arbitrariness of the process.

In real-world industrial anomaly detection, it is crucial to accurately identify anomalies with physical complexity, such as transparent or reflective surfaces, occlusions, and low-contrast contaminations. The recently proposed MVTec AD 2 dataset significantly narrows the gap between publicly available benchmarks and anomalies found in real-world industrial environments. To address the challenges posed by this dataset--such as complex and varying lighting conditions and real anomalies with large scale differences--we propose a fully training-free anomaly detection and segmentation method based on feature extraction using the DINOv2 model named SuperAD. Our method carefully selects a small number of normal reference images and constructs a memory bank by leveraging the strong representational power of DINOv2. Anomalies are then segmented by performing nearest neighbor matching between test image features and the memory bank.

In contrast to traditional class incremental learning, this novel setting introduces unique challenges and research opportunities, particularly through the integration of unlabeled data into the training process. In the CIR scenario, encountered classes may reappear in later learning experiences, and each experience may involve only a subset of the overall class distribution. Additionally, the unlabeled data provided during training may include instances of unseen classes, or irrelevant classes which should be ignored. Our approach focuses on retaining previously learned knowledge by utilizing knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling techniques. The key characteristic of our method is the exploitation of unlabeled data during training, in order to maintain optimal performance on instances of previously encountered categories and reduce the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting.

However, the compact size of most drones presents a significant challenge, as traditional supervised point cloud or image-based object detection methods often fail to identify such small objects effectively. This paper proposes a simple UAV detection method using an unsupervised pipeline. It uses spatial-temporal sequence processing to fuse multiple lidar datasets effectively, tracking and determining the position of UAVs, so as to detect and track UAVs in challenging environments. Our method performs front and rear background segmentation of point clouds through a global-local sequence clusterer and parses point cloud data from both the spatial-temporal density and spatial-temporal voxels of the point cloud.

It is based on a synthetic driving video dataset - SHIFT. The source model is trained on images taken during daytime in clear weather. Domain changes at test-time are mainly caused by varying weather conditions and times of day. The TTA methods are evaluated in each image sequence (video) separately, meaning the model is reset to the source model state before the next sequence. Images come one by one and a prediction has to be made at the arrival of each frame. Each sequence is composed of 401 images and starts with the source domain, then gradually drifts to a different one (changing weather or time of day) until the middle of the sequence. In the second half of the sequence, the domain gradually shifts back to the source one. Ground truth data is available only for the validation split of the SHIFT dataset, in which there are only six sequences that start and end with the source domain. We conduct an analysis specifically on those sequences. Ground truth data for test split, on which the developed TTA methods are evaluated for leader board ranking, are not publicly available.

This paper introduces EMNLP, an Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 14 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations. Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection, revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.

Fermi Problems: A New  Reasoning Challenge for AI,Ashwin Kalyan; Abhinav Kumar; Arjun Chandrasekaran; Ashish Sabharwal; Peter Clark,"Many real-world problems require the combined application of multiple reasoning abilities employing suitable abstractions, commonsense knowledge, and creative synthesis of problem-solving strategies. To help advance AI systems towards such capabilities, we propose a new reasoning challenge, namely Fermi Problems (FPs), which are questions whose answers can only be approximately estimated because their precise computation is either impractical or impossible. For example, ""How much would the sea level rise if all ice in the world melted?"" FPs are commonly used in quizzes and interviews to bring out and evaluate the creative reasoning abilities of humans. To do the same for AI systems, we present two datasets: 1) A collection of 1k real-world FPs sourced from quizzes and olympiads; and 2) a bank of 10k synthetic FPs of intermediate complexity to serve as a sandbox for the harder real-world challenge. In addition to question answer pairs, the datasets contain detailed solutions in the form of an executable program and supporting facts, helping in supervision and evaluation of intermediate steps. We demonstrate that even extensively fine-tuned large scale language models perform poorly on these datasets, on average making estimates that are off by two orders of magnitude.

Despite growing interest in the subfield, a criticism of this work is that it lacks actionable insights and therefore has little impact on NLP. In this paper, we seek to quantify the impact of IA research on the broader field of NLP. We approach this with a mixed-methods analysis of: (1) a citation graph of 185K+ papers built from all papers published at ACL and EMNLP conferences from 2018 to 2023, and their references and citations, and (2) a survey of 138 members of the NLP community. Our quantitative results show that IA work is well-cited outside of IA, and central in the NLP citation graph. Through qualitative analysis of survey responses and manual annotation of 556 papers, we find that NLP researchers build on findings from IA work and perceive it as important for progress in NLP, multiple subfields, and rely on its findings and terminology for their own work. Many novel methods are proposed based on IA findings and highly influenced by them, but highly influential non-IA work cites IA findings without being driven by them.

The charging communication of CCS is defined by the ISO 15118 standards, which have been improved over the years. Most notably, in 2014, important security features such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and usability enhancements such as Plug and Charge were introduced.  In this paper, we conduct the first measurement study of publicly deployed CCS DC charging stations to capture the state of deployment for different protocol versions and to better understand the attack surface of the EV charging infrastructure. In our evaluation, we examine 325 chargers manufactured between April 2013 and June 2023, and installed as late as May 2024 by 26 manufacturers across 4 European countries. We find that only 12% of the charging stations we analyzed implement TLS at all, leaving all others vulnerable to attacks that have already been demonstrated many years ago. We observe an increasing trend in support for ISO 15118-2 over the years, reaching 70% of chargers manufactured in 2023. We further notice that most chargers use a decade-old firmware for their HomePlug modems, which could contain vulnerabilities that have been patched since.

2202.02104v2,Brokenwire : Wireless Disruption of CCS Electric Vehicle Charging,Sebastian KÃ¶hler; Richard Baker; Martin Strohmeier; Ivan Martinovic,"We present a novel attack against the Combined Charging System, one of the most widely used DC rapid charging technologies for electric vehicles (EVs). Our attack, Brokenwire, interrupts necessary control communication between the vehicle and charger, causing charging sessions to abort. The attack requires only temporary physical proximity and can be conducted wirelessly from a distance, allowing individual vehicles or entire fleets to be disrupted stealthily and simultaneously. In addition, it can be mounted with off-the-shelf radio hardware and minimal technical knowledge. By exploiting CSMA/CA behavior, only a very weak signal needs to be induced into the victim to disrupt communication - exceeding the effectiveness of broadband noise jamming by three orders of magnitude. The exploited behavior is a required part of the HomePlug Green PHY, DIN 70121 & ISO 15118 standards and all known implementations exhibit it. We first study the attack in a controlled testbed and then demonstrate it against eight vehicles and 20 chargers in real deployments. We find the attack to be successful in the real world, at ranges up to 47 m, for a power budget of less than 1 W. We further show that the attack can work between the floors of a building (e.g., multi-story parking), through perimeter fences, and from `drive-by' attacks. We present a heuristic model to estimate the number of vehicles that can be attacked simultaneously for a given output power. Brokenwire has immediate implications for a substantial proportion of the around 12 million battery EVs on the roads worldwide - and profound effects on the new wave of electrification for vehicle fleets, both for private enterprise and crucial public services, as well as electric buses, trucks and small ships. As such, we conducted a disclosure to the industry and discussed a range of mitigation techniques that could be deployed to limit the impact.",2022-02-04,2024-03-26,cs.CR,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02104v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02104v2,10.14722/ndss.2023.23251,"30th Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium,

Traditional security has accomplished a long way toward protecting well-defined goals such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity. However, with the growing sophistication of the attacks and the complexity of the system, the protection using traditional methods could be cost-prohibitive. A new perspective and a new theoretical foundation are needed to understand security from a strategic and decision-making perspective. Game theory provides a natural framework to capture the adversarial and defensive interactions between an attacker and a defender. It provides a quantitative assessment of security, prediction of security outcomes, and a mechanism design tool that can enable security-by-design and reverse the attacker's advantage. This tutorial provides an overview of diverse methodologies from game theory that includes games of incomplete information, dynamic games, mechanism design theory to offer a modern theoretic underpinning of a science of cybersecurity.

Moreover, high precision, recall, and F1-scores were attained across all classifiers while substantially reducing training and testing times, making the framework highly suitable for real-time applications. To ensure fair detection across diverse attack types, dataset balancing via downsampling was applied to address class imbalance challenges.

Despite this, existing MPC-based GBDT frameworks face efficiency challenges due to high communication costs and the computation burden of non-linear operations, such as division and sigmoid calculations. In this work, we introduce Guard-GBDT, an innovative framework tailored for efficient and privacy-preserving GBDT training on vertical datasets. Guard-GBDT bypasses MPC-unfriendly division and sigmoid functions by using more streamlined approximations and reduces communication overhead by compressing the messages exchanged during gradient aggregation. We implement a prototype of Guard-GBDT and extensively evaluate its performance and accuracy on various real-world datasets.

This innovation enables GPUs to securely process AI workloads, providing a robust and efficient solution for handling sensitive data. For end users, transitioning to GPU-CC mode is seamless, requiring no modifications to existing AI applications. However, this ease of adoption contrasts sharply with the complexity of the underlying proprietary systems. The lack of transparency presents significant challenges for security researchers seeking a deeper understanding of GPU-CC's architecture and operational mechanisms.  The challenges of analyzing the NVIDIA GPU-CC system arise from a scarcity of detailed specifications, the proprietary nature of the ecosystem, and the complexity of product design. In this paper, we aim to demystify the implementation of NVIDIA GPU-CC system by piecing together the fragmented and incomplete information disclosed from various sources. Our investigation begins with a high-level discussion of the threat model and security principles before delving into the low-level details of each system component.

(STOC 2012), allows for performing arithmetic computations directly on ciphertexts encrypted under distinct keys. Subsequent works by Chen and Dai et al. (CCS 2019) and Kim and Song et al. (CCS 2023) extended this concept by proposing multi-key BFV/CKKS variants, referred to as the CDKS scheme. These variants incorporate asymptotically optimal techniques to facilitate secure computation across multiple data providers. In this paper, we identify a critical security vulnerability in the CDKS scheme when applied to multiparty secure computation tasks, such as privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL). In particular, we show that CDKS may inadvertently leak plaintext information from one party to others. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new scheme, SMHE (Secure Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption), which incorporates a novel masking mechanism into the multi-key BFV and CKKS frameworks to ensure that plaintexts remain confidential throughout the computation. We implement a PPFL application using SMHE and demonstrate that it provides significantly improved security with only a modest overhead in homomorphic evaluation. For instance, our PPFL model based on multi-key CKKS incurs less than a 2\times runtime and communication traffic increase compared to the CDKS-based PPFL model.

To enable secure evaluation of practical functions, it is essential to computing $\mathsf{Real}(x)$ from shared inputs, as protocols take shares as input. At USENIX'25, Guo et al. proposed an efficient method for computing signed integer values $\mathsf{int}(x)$ from shares, which can be extended to compute $\mathsf{Real}(x)$. However, their approach imposes a restrictive input constraint $|x| < \frac{L}{3}$ for $x \in \mathbb{Z}_L$, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we significantly relax this constraint to $|x| < B$ for any $B \leq \frac{L}{2}$, where $B = \frac{L}{2}$ corresponding to the natural representable range in $x \in \mathbb{Z}_L$. This relaxes the restrictions and enables the computation of $\mathsf{Real}(x)$ with loose or no input constraints. Building upon this foundation, we present a generalized framework for designing secure protocols for a broad class of functions, including integer division ($\lfloor \frac{x}{d} \rfloor$), trigonometric ($\sin(x)$) and exponential ($e^{-x}$) functions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocols achieve both high efficiency and high accuracy. Notably, our protocol for evaluating $e^{-x}$ reduces communication costs to approximately 31% of those in SirNN (S&P 21) and Bolt (S&P 24), with runtime speedups of up to $5.53 \times$ and $3.09 \times$, respectively.

In this paper, we examine these claims and find that they arise from a modeling flaw in the SEC'25 paper. Most critically, the SEC'25 paper's simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails.

BGP hijacks still occurr daily. While full deployment of Route Origin Validation (ROV) is ongoing, attackers have already adapted, launching post-ROV attacks such as forged-origin hijacks. To detect these, recent approaches like DFOH [Holterbach et al., USENIX NSDI '24] and BEAM [Chen et al., USENIX Security '24] apply machine learning (ML) to analyze data from globally distributed BGP monitors, assuming anomalies will stand out against historical patterns. However, this assumption overlooks a key threat: BGP monitors themselves can be misled by adversaries injecting bogus routes. This paper shows that state-of-the-art hijack detection systems like DFOH and BEAM are vulnerable to data poisoning. Using large-scale BGP simulations, we show that attackers can evade detection with just a handful of crafted announcements beyond the actual hijack. These announcements are indeed sufficient to corrupt the knowledge base used by ML-based defenses and distort the metrics they rely on.

Sultan; Xinlong Guan; Josef Pieprzyk; Wei Ni; Sharif Abuadbba; Hajime Suzuki,"As 5G networks expand into critical infrastructure, secure and efficient user authentication is more important than ever. The 5G-AKA protocol, standardized by 3GPP in TS 33.501, is central to authentication in current 5G deployments. It provides mutual authentication, user privacy, and key secrecy. However, despite its adoption, 5G-AKA has known limitations in both security and performance. While it focuses on protecting privacy against passive attackers, recent studies show its vulnerabilities to active attacks. It also relies on a sequence number mechanism to prevent replay attacks, requiring perfect synchronization between the device and the core network. This stateful design adds complexity, causes desynchronization, and incurs extra communication overhead. More critically, 5G-AKA lacks Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), exposing past communications if long-term keys are compromised-an increasing concern amid sophisticated threats. This paper proposes an enhanced authentication protocol that builds on 5G-AKA's design while addressing its shortcomings. First, we introduce a stateless version that removes sequence number reliance, reducing complexity while staying compatible with existing SIM cards and infrastructure. We then extend this design to add PFS with minimal cryptographic overhead. Both protocols are rigorously analyzed using ProVerif, confirming their compliance with all major security requirements, including resistance to passive and active attacks, as well as those defined by 3GPP and academic studies. We also prototype both protocols and evaluate their performance against 5G-AKA and 5G-AKA' (USENIX'21).

A common approach is to perturb the message-passing process, which forms the core of most GNN architectures. However, existing methods typically incur a privacy cost that grows linearly with the number of layers (Usenix Security'23), ultimately requiring excessive noise to maintain a reasonable privacy level. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when deep GNNs are necessary to capture complex and long-range interactions in graphs. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the privacy budget can converge with respect to the number of layers by applying privacy amplification techniques to the message-passing process, exploiting the contractive properties inherent to standard GNN operations. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a simple yet effective Contractive Graph Layer (CGL) that ensures the contractiveness required for theoretical guarantees while preserving model utility. Our framework, CARIBOU, supports both training and inference, equipped with a contractive aggregation module, a privacy allocation module, and a privacy auditing module.

Liu,"The rise of massive networks across diverse domains necessitates sophisticated graph analytics, often involving sensitive data and raising privacy concerns. This paper addresses these challenges using local differential privacy (LDP), which enforces privacy at the individual level, where no third-party entity is trusted, unlike centralized models that assume a trusted curator. We introduce novel LDP algorithms for two fundamental graph statistics: k-core decomposition and triangle counting. Our approach leverages input-dependent private graph properties, specifically the degeneracy and maximum degree of the graph, to improve theoretical utility. Unlike prior methods, our error bounds are determined by the maximum degree rather than the total number of edges, resulting in significantly tighter guarantees. For triangle counting, we improve upon the work of Imola, Murakami, and Chaudhury [USENIX Security `21, `22], which bounds error in terms of edge count. Instead, our algorithm achieves bounds based on graph degeneracy by leveraging a private out-degree orientation, a refined variant of Eden et al.'s randomized response technique [ICALP `23], and a novel analysis, yielding stronger guarantees than prior work. Beyond theoretical gains, we are the first to evaluate local DP algorithms in a distributed simulation, unlike prior work tested on a single processor. Experiments on real-world graphs show substantial accuracy gains: our k-core decomposition achieves errors within 3x of exact values, far outperforming the 131x error in the baseline of Dhulipala et al.

Standing in contrast to existing studies all focusing on spatial (or static) imprints within the targeted underlying victim models, we present a fresh temporal paradigm for understanding these attacks. Of paramount discovery is that these imprints are encapsulated within a single loss metric, spanning universally across diverse tasks such as classification and regression, and modalities including image, text, and audio. Recognizing the distinct nature of loss between adversarial and clean examples, we exploit this temporal imprint for AE detection by proposing TRAIT (TRaceable Adversarial temporal trajectory ImprinTs). TRAIT operates under minimal assumptions without prior knowledge of attacks, thereby framing the detection challenge as a one-class classification problem. However, detecting AEs is still challenged by significant overlaps between the constructed synthetic losses of adversarial and clean examples due to the absence of ground truth for incoming inputs. TRAIT addresses this challenge by converting the synthetic loss into a spectrum signature, using the technique of Fast Fourier Transform to highlight the discrepancies, drawing inspiration from the temporal nature of the imprints, analogous to time-series signals. Across 12 AE attacks including SMACK (USENIX Sec'2023), TRAIT demonstrates consistent outstanding performance across comprehensively evaluated modalities, tasks, datasets, and model architectures. In all scenarios, TRAIT achieves an AE detection accuracy exceeding 97%, often around 99%, while maintaining a false rejection rate of 1%.

Dissecting Ethereum's Slow Liquidity Drain Scams,Minh Trung Tran; Nasrin Sohrabi; Zahir Tari; Qin Wang; Minhui Xue; Xiaoyu Xia,"We identify the slow liquidity drain (SLID) scam, an insidious and highly profitable threat to decentralized finance (DeFi), posing a large-scale, persistent, and growing risk to the ecosystem. Unlike traditional scams such as rug pulls or honeypots (USENIX Sec'19, USENIX Sec'23), SLID gradually siphons funds from liquidity pools over extended periods, making detection significantly more challenging. In this paper, we conducted the first large-scale empirical analysis of 319,166 liquidity pools across six major decentralized exchanges (DEXs) since 2018. We identified 3,117 SLID affected liquidity pools, resulting in cumulative losses of more than US$103 million. We propose a rule-based heuristic and an enhanced machine learning model for early detection. Our machine learning model achieves a detection speed 4.77 times faster than the heuristic while maintaining 95% accuracy.

2508.13083v1,Congested Clique Counting for Local Gibbs Distributions,Joshua Z. Sobel,"There are well established reductions between combinatorial sampling and counting problems (Jerrum, Valiant, Vazirani TCS 1986). Building off of a very recent parallel algorithm utilizing this connection (Liu, Yin, Zhang arxiv 2024), we demonstrate the first approximate counting algorithm in the CongestedClique for a wide range of problems. Most interestingly, we present an algorithm for approximating the number of $q$-colorings of a graph within $\epsilon$-multiplicative error, when $q>\alpha\Delta$ for any constant $\alpha>2$, in $\Tilde{O}\big(\frac{n^{1/3}}{\epsilon^2}\big)$ rounds. More generally, we achieve a runtime of $\Tilde{O}\big(\frac{n^{1/3}}{\epsilon^2}\big)$ rounds for approximating the partition function of Gibbs distributions defined over graphs when simple locality and fast mixing conditions hold. Gibbs distributions are widely used in fields such as machine learning and statistical physics. We obtain our result by providing an algorithm to draw $n$ random samples from a distributed Markov chain in parallel, using similar ideas to triangle counting (Dolev, Lenzen, Peled DISC 2012) and semiring matrix multiplication (Censor-Hillel, Kaski, Korhonen, Lenzen, Paz, Suomela PODC 2015). Aside from counting problems, this result may be interesting for other applications requiring a large number of samples. In the special case of estimating the partition function of the hardcore model, also known as counting weighted independent sets, we can do even better and achieve an $\Tilde{O}\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\big)$ round algorithm, when the fugacity $\lambda \leq \frac{\alpha}{\Delta-1}$, where $\alpha$ is an arbitrary constant less than $1$.",2025-08-18,2025-08-18,"cs.DC, cs.DS",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13083v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13083v1,,,PODC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:37:56.146726
2507.08348v3,Content-Oblivious Leader Election in 2-Edge-Connected Networks,JÃ©rÃ©mie Chalopin; Yi-Jun Chang; Lyuting Chen; Giuseppe A. Di Luna; Haoran Zhou,"Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sela (PODC 2022 & Distributed Computing 2023) studied fully-defective asynchronous networks, where communication channels may suffer an extreme form of alteration errors, rendering messages completely corrupted. The model is equivalent to content-oblivious computation, where nodes communicate solely via pulses. They showed that if the network is 2-edge-connected, then any algorithm for a noiseless setting can be simulated in the fully-defective setting; otherwise, no non-trivial computation is possible in the fully-defective setting. However, their simulation requires a predesignated leader, which they conjectured to be necessary for any non-trivial content-oblivious task.  In this work, we present two results:  General 2-edge-connected topologies: First, we show an asynchronous content-oblivious leader election algorithm that quiescently terminates in any 2-edge-connected network with message complexity $O(m \cdot N \cdot \mathsf{ID}_{\min})$, where $m$ is the number of edges, $N$ is a known upper bound on the number of nodes, and $\mathsf{ID}_{\min}$ is the smallest $\mathsf{ID}$. Combined with the above simulation, this result shows that whenever a size bound $N$ is known, any noiseless algorithm can be simulated in the fully-defective model without a preselected leader, fully refuting the conjecture.  Unoriented rings: We then show that the knowledge of $N$ can be dropped in unoriented ring topologies by presenting a quiescently terminating election algorithm with message complexity $O(n \cdot \mathsf{ID}_{\max})$ that matches the previous bound. Consequently, this result constitutes a strict improvement over the previous leader election in oriented rings by Frei, Gelles, Ghazy, and Nolin (DISC 2024) and shows that, on rings, fully-defective and noiseless communication are computationally equivalent, with no additional assumptions.",2025-07-11,2025-08-19,cs.DC,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08348v3,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08348v3,,,PODC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:37:56.146766

2506.04919v1,Improved Byzantine Agreement under an Adaptive Adversary,Fabien Dufoulon; Gopal Pandurangan,"Byzantine agreement is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed computing that has been studied intensively for the last four decades. Much of the research has focused on a static Byzantine adversary, where the adversary is constrained to choose the Byzantine nodes in advance of the protocol's execution. This work focuses on the harder case of an adaptive Byzantine adversary that can choose the Byzantine nodes \emph{adaptively} based on the protocol's execution. While efficient $O(\log n)$-round protocols ($n$ is the total number of nodes) are known for the static adversary (Goldwasser, Pavlov, and Vaikuntanathan, FOCS 2006) tolerating up to $t < n/(3+\epsilon)$ Byzantine nodes, $\Omega(t/\sqrt{n \log n})$ rounds is a well-known lower bound for adaptive adversary [Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or, PODC 1998]. The best-known protocol for adaptive adversary runs in $O(t/\log n)$ rounds [Chor and Coan, IEEE Trans. Soft. Engg., 1985].  This work presents a synchronous randomized Byzantine agreement protocol under an adaptive adversary that improves over previous results. Our protocol works under the powerful \emph{adaptive rushing adversary in the full information model}. That is, we assume that the Byzantine nodes can behave arbitrarily and maliciously, have knowledge about the entire state of the network at every round, including random choices made by all the nodes up to and including the current round, have unlimited computational power, and may collude among themselves. Furthermore, the adversary can \emph{adaptively} corrupt up to $t < n/3$ nodes based on the protocol's execution. We present a simple randomized Byzantine agreement protocol that runs in $O(\min\{t^2\log n/n, t/\log n\})$ rounds that improves over the long-standing bound of $O(t/\log n)$ rounds due to Chor and Coan [IEEE Trans. Soft. Engg., 1985].",2025-06-05,2025-06-05,"cs.DC, cs.DS",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04919v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04919v1,,,PODC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:37:56.146812
2505.23649v1,Complementary Time-Space Tradeoff for Self-Stabilizing Leader Election:  Polynomial States Meet Sublinear Time,Yuichi Sudo,"We study the self-stabilizing leader election (SS-LE) problem in the population protocol model, assuming exact knowledge of the population size $n$. Burman, Chen, Chen, Doty, Nowak, Severson, and Xu (PODC 2021) showed that this problem can be solved in $O(n)$ expected time with $O(n)$ states. Recently, G\k{a}sieniec, Grodzicki, and Stachowiak (PODC 2025) proved that $n+O(\log n)$ states suffice to achieve $O(n \log n)$ time both in expectation and with high probability (w.h.p.). If substantially more states are available, sublinear time can be achieved. Burman~et~al.~(PODC 2021) presented a $2^{O(n^\rho\log n)}$-state SS-LE protocol with a parameter $\rho$: setting $\rho = \Theta(\log n)$ yields an optimal $O(\log n)$ time both in expectation and w.h.p., while $\rho = \Theta(1)$ results in $O(\rho\,n^{1/(\rho+1)})$ expected time. Very recently, Austin, Berenbrink, Friedetzky, G\""otte, and Hintze (PODC 2025) presented a novel SS-LE protocol parameterized by a positive integer $\rho$ with $1 \le \rho < n/2$ that solves SS-LE in $O(\frac{n}{\rho}\cdot\log n)$ time w.h.p.\ using $2^{O(\rho^2\log n)}$ states. This paper independently presents yet another time--space tradeoff of SS-LE: for any positive integer $\rho$ with $1 \le \rho \le \sqrt{n}$, SS-LE can be achieved within $O\left(\frac{n}{\rho}\cdot \log\rho\right)$ expected time using $2^{2\rho\lg\rho + O(\log n)}$ states. The proposed protocol uses significantly fewer states than the protocol of Austin~et~al.\ requires to achieve any expected stabilization time above $\Theta(\sqrt{n}\log n)$. When $\rho = \Theta\left(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}\right)$,the proposed protocol is the first to achieve sublinear time while using only polynomially many states. A limitation of our protocol is that the constraint $\rho\le\sqrt{n}$ prevents achieving $o(\sqrt{n}\log n)$ time, whereas the protocol of Austin et~al.\ can surpass this bound.",2025-05-29,2025-05-29,cs.DC,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23649v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23649v1,,,PODC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:37:56.146834
2505.11430v1,Computing in a Faulty Congested Clique,Keren Censor-Hillel; Pedro Soto,"We study a \textsf{Faulty Congested Clique} model, in which an adversary may fail nodes in the network throughout the computation. We show that any task of $O(n\log{n})$-bit input per node can be solved in roughly $n$ rounds, where $n$ is the size of the network. This nearly matches the linear upper bound on the complexity of the non-faulty \clique model for such problems, by learning the entire input, and it holds in the faulty model even with a linear number of faults.  Our main contribution is that we establish that one can do much better by looking more closely at the computation. Given a deterministic algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ for the non-faulty \textsf{Congested Clique} model, we show how to transform it into an algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ for the faulty model, with an overhead that could be as small as some logarithmic-in-$n$ factor, by considering refined complexity measures of $\mathcal{A}$.  As an exemplifying application of our approach, we show that the $O(n^{1/3})$-round complexity of semi-ring matrix multiplication [Censor{-}Hillel, Kaski, Korhonen, Lenzen, Paz, Suomela, PODC 2015] remains the same up to polylog factors in the faulty model, even if the adversary can fail $99\%$ of the nodes.",2025-05-16,2025-05-16,"cs.DS, cs.DC",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11430v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11430v1,,,PODC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:37:56.146856

(Distributed Computing 2008). We consider a more general version of this problem known as plurality consensus, which has already been studied intensively in the literature. In this problem, each node in a system of $n$ nodes, has initially one of $k$ different opinions, and they need to agree on the (relative) majority opinion. In particular, we consider the important and intensively studied model of Undecided State Dynamics.  Our main contribution is an almost tight lower bound on the stabilization time: we prove that there exists an initial configuration, even with bias $\Delta = \omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$, where stabilization requires $\Omega(kn\log \frac {\sqrt n} {k \log n})$ interactions, or equivalently, $\Omega(k\log \frac {\sqrt n} {k \log n})$ parallel time for any $k = o\left(\frac {\sqrt n}{\log n}\right)$. This bound is tight for any $ k \le n^{\frac 1 2 - \epsilon}$, where $\epsilon >0$ can be any small constant, as Amir et al.~(PODC'23) gave a $O(k\log n)$ parallel time upper bound for $k = O\left(\frac {\sqrt n} {\log ^2 n}\right)$.",2025-05-05,2025-05-05,cs.DC,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02765v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02765v1,,,PODC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:37:56.146882
2505.01210v1,A Space-Time Trade-off for Fast Self-Stabilizing Leader Election in  Population Protocols,Henry Austin; Petra Berenbrink; Tom Friedetzky; Thorsten GÃ¶tte; Lukas Hintze,"We consider the problem of self-stabilizing leader election in the population model by Angluin, Aspnes, Diamadi, Fischer, and Peralta (JDistComp '06). The population model is a well-established and powerful model for asynchronous, distributed computation with a large number of applications. For self-stabilizing leader election, the population of $n$ anonymous agents, interacting in uniformly random pairs, must stabilize with a single leader from any possible initial configuration.  The focus of this paper is to develop time-efficient self-stabilizing protocols whilst minimizing the number of states. We present a parametrized protocol, which, for a suitable setting, achieves the asymptotically optimal time $O(\log n)$ using $2^{O(n^2\log n)}$ states (throughout the paper, ``time'' refers to ``parallel time'', i.e., the number of pairwise interactions divided by $n$). This is a significant improvement over the previously best protocol Sublinear-Time-SSR due to Burman, Chen, Chen, Doty, Nowak, Severson, and Xu (PODC '21), which requires $2^{O(n^{\log n}\log n)}$ states for the same time bound. In general, for $1\le r\le n/2$, our protocol requires $2^{O(r^2\log{n})}$ states and stabilizes in time $O((n\log{n})/r)$, w.h.p.; the above result is achieved for $r=\Theta(n)$. For $r=\log^2n$ our protocol requires only sub-linear time using only $2^{O(\log^3 n)}$ states, resolving an open problem stated in that paper. Sublinear-Time-SSR requires $O(\log n\cdot n^{1/(H+1)})$ time using $2^{\Theta(n^H) \cdot \log n}$ states for all $1\le H\le\Theta(\log n)$.  Similar to previous works, it solves leader election by assigning a unique rank from $1$ through $n$ to each agent. The principal bottleneck for self-stabilizing ranking usually is to detect if there exist agents with the same rank. One of our main conceptual contributions is a novel technique for collision detection.",2025-05-02,2025-05-02,cs.DC,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01210v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01210v1,,,PODC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:37:56.146912
2505.00338v3,New Distributed Interactive Proofs for Planarity: A Matter of Left and  Right,Yuval Gil; Merav Parter,"We provide new distributed interactive proofs (DIP) for planarity and related graph families. The notion of a \emph{distributed interactive proof} (DIP) was introduced by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena (PODC 2018). In this setting, the verifier consists of $n$ nodes connected by a communication graph $G$. The prover is a single entity that communicates with all nodes by short messages. The goal is to verify that the graph $G$ satisfies a certain property (e.g., planarity) in a small number of rounds, and with a small communication bound, denoted as the \emph{proof size}.  Prior work by Naor, Parter and Yogev (SODA 2020) presented a DIP for planarity that uses three interaction rounds and a proof size of $O(\log n)$. Feuilloley et al.\ (PODC 2020) showed that the same can be achieved with a single interaction round and without randomization, by providing a proof labeling scheme with a proof size of $O(\log n)$. In a subsequent work, Bousquet, Feuilloley, and Pierron (OPODIS 2021) achieved the same bound for related graph families such as outerplanarity, series-parallel graphs, and graphs of treewidth at most $2$.

2504.13003v2,Towards Optimal Distributed Edge Coloring with Fewer Colors,Manuel Jakob; Yannic Maus; Florian Schager,"There is a huge difference in techniques and runtimes of distributed algorithms for problems that can be solved by a sequential greedy algorithm and those that cannot. A prime example of this contrast appears in the edge coloring problem: while $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(\log^{\ast}(n))$ rounds on constant-degree graphs, the seemingly minor reduction to $(2\Delta-2)$ colors leads to an $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound [Chang, He, Li, Pettie & Uitto, SODA'18]. Understanding this sharp divide between very local problems and inherently more global ones remains a central open question in distributed computing and it is a core focus of this paper.  As our main contribution we design a deterministic distributed $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-round reduction from the $(2\Delta-2)$-edge coloring problem to the much easier $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring problem. This reduction is optimal, as the $(2\Delta-2)$-edge coloring problem admits an $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound, whereas the $2\Delta-1$-edge coloring problem can be solved in $\mathcal{O}(\log^{\ast}n)$ rounds. By plugging in the $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring algorithms from [Balliu, Brandt, Kuhn & Olivetti, PODC'22] running in $\mathcal{O}(\log^{12}\Delta + \log^{\ast} n)$ rounds, we obtain an optimal runtime of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ rounds as long as $\Delta = 2^{\mathcal{O}(\log^{1/12} n)}$. Furthermore, on general graphs our reduction improves the runtime from $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log^3 n)$ to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log^{5/3} n)$.  In addition, we also obtain an optimal $\mathcal{O}(\log \log n)$-round randomized reduction of $(2\Delta - 2)$-edge coloring to $(2\Delta - 1)$-edge coloring. Lastly, we obtain an $\mathcal{O}(\log_\Delta n)$-round reduction from the $(2\Delta-1)$-edge coloring, albeit to the somewhat harder maximal independent set (MIS) problem.",2025-04-17,2025-05-26,"cs.DS, cs.DC",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13003v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13003v2,,,PODC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:37:56.146962

In order to provide fast data access, the NameNode (NN) in HDFS maintains the metadata of all files in its main-memory. Hadoop performs well with a small number of large files that require relatively little metadata in the NN s memory. But for a large number of small files, Hadoop has problems such as NN memory overload caused by the huge metadata size of these small files. We present a new type of archive file, Hadoop Perfect File (HPF), to solve HDFS s small files problem by merging small files into a large file on HDFS. Existing archive files offer limited functionality and have poor performance when accessing a file in the merged file due to the fact that during metadata lookup it is necessary to read and process the entire index file(s). In contrast, HPF file can directly access the metadata of a particular file from its index file without having to process it entirely. The HPF index system uses two hash functions: file s metadata are distributed through index files by using a dynamic hash function and, for each index file, we build an order preserving perfect hash function that preserves the position of each file s metadata in the index file. The HPF design will only read the part of the index file that contains the metadata of the searched file during its access. HPF file also supports the file appending functionality after its creation. Our experiments show that HPF can be more than 40% faster file s access from the original HDFS. If we don t consider the caching effect, HPF s file access is around 179% faster than MapFile and 11294% faster than HAR file. If we consider caching effect, HPF is around 35% faster than MapFile and 105% faster than HAR file.",2019-03-14,2019-04-26,cs.DC,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05838v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05838v2,10.1016/j.jpdc.2021.05.011,,DISC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:37:59.719887

The robots are initially placed at distinct positions, forming a rotationally asymmetric configuration. The robots agree on the clockwise direction. In the $\theta$-visibility model, a robot can only see those robots on the circle that are at an angular distance $<\theta$ from it. Di Luna \textit{et. al.} [DISC'20] have shown that, in $\pi/2$ visibility, gathering is impossible. In addition, they provided an algorithm for robots with $\pi$ visibility, operating under a semi-synchronous scheduler. In the $\pi$ visibility model, only one point, the point at the angular distance $\pi$ is removed from the visibility. Ghosh \textit{et. al.} [SSS'23] provided a gathering algorithm for $\pi$ visibility model with robot having finite memory ($\mathcal{FSTA}$), operating under a special asynchronous scheduler.  If the robots can see all points on the circle, then the gathering can be done by electing a leader in the weakest robot model under a fully asynchronous scheduler. However, previous works have shown that even the removal of one point from the visibility makes gathering difficult. In both works, the robots had rigid movement. In this work, we propose an algorithm that solves the gathering problem under the $\pi$-visibility model for robots that have finite communication ability ($\mathcal{FCOM}$).

Di Luna; Haoran Zhou,"Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sela (PODC 2022 & Distributed Computing 2023) studied fully-defective asynchronous networks, where communication channels may suffer an extreme form of alteration errors, rendering messages completely corrupted. The model is equivalent to content-oblivious computation, where nodes communicate solely via pulses. They showed that if the network is 2-edge-connected, then any algorithm for a noiseless setting can be simulated in the fully-defective setting; otherwise, no non-trivial computation is possible in the fully-defective setting. However, their simulation requires a predesignated leader, which they conjectured to be necessary for any non-trivial content-oblivious task.  In this work, we present two results:  General 2-edge-connected topologies: First, we show an asynchronous content-oblivious leader election algorithm that quiescently terminates in any 2-edge-connected network with message complexity $O(m \cdot N \cdot \mathsf{ID}_{\min})$, where $m$ is the number of edges, $N$ is a known upper bound on the number of nodes, and $\mathsf{ID}_{\min}$ is the smallest $\mathsf{ID}$. Combined with the above simulation, this result shows that whenever a size bound $N$ is known, any noiseless algorithm can be simulated in the fully-defective model without a preselected leader, fully refuting the conjecture.  Unoriented rings: We then show that the knowledge of $N$ can be dropped in unoriented ring topologies by presenting a quiescently terminating election algorithm with message complexity $O(n \cdot \mathsf{ID}_{\max})$ that matches the previous bound. Consequently, this result constitutes a strict improvement over the previous leader election in oriented rings by Frei, Gelles, Ghazy, and Nolin (DISC 2024) and shows that, on rings, fully-defective and noiseless communication are computationally equivalent, with no additional assumptions.",2025-07-11,2025-08-19,cs.DC,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08348v3,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08348v3,,,DISC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:38:03.313945
2505.04564v1,Optimal Deterministic Rendezvous in Labeled Lines,Yann Bourreau; Ananth Narayanan; Alexandre Nolin,"In a rendezvous task, a set of mobile agents dispersed in a network have to gather at an arbitrary common site. We consider the rendezvous problem on the infinite labeled line, with $2$ initially asleep agents, without communication, and a synchronous notion of time. Nodes are labeled with unique positive integers. The initial distance between the two agents is denoted by $D$. Time is divided into rounds. We count time from when an agent first wakes up, and denote by $\tau$ the delay between the agents' wake up times. If awake in a given round $T$, an agent has three options: stay at its current node $v$, take port $0$, or take port $1$. If it decides to stay, the agent is still at node $v$ in round $T+1$. Otherwise, it is at one of the two neighbors of $v$ on the line, based on the port it chose. The agents achieve rendezvous in $T$ rounds if they are at the same node in round $T$. We aim for a deterministic algorithm for this task.  The problem was recently considered by Miller and Pelc [DISC 2023]. With $\ell_{\max}$ the largest label of the two starting nodes, they showed that no algorithm can guarantee rendezvous in $o(D \log^* \ell_{\max})$ rounds. The lower bound follows from a connection with the LOCAL model of distributed computing, and holds even if the agents are guaranteed simultaneous wake-up ($\tau = 0$) and are given $D$ as advice. Miller and Pelc also gave an algorithm of optimal matching complexity $O(D \log^* \ell_{\max})$ when $D$ is known to the agents, but only obtained the higher bound of $O(D^2 (\log^* \ell_{\max})^3)$ when $D$ is unknown.  We improve this second complexity to a tight $O(D \log^* \ell_{\max})$. In fact, our algorithm achieves rendezvous in $O(D \log^* \ell_{\min})$ rounds, where $\ell_{\min}$ is the smallest label within distance $O(D)$ of the two starting positions.",2025-05-07,2025-05-07,"cs.DC, cs.DS",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04564v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04564v1,10.1145/3732772.3733537,,DISC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:38:03.313971
2504.21620v1,Deterministic Distributed DFS via Cycle Separators in Planar Graphs,Benjamin Jauregui; Pedro Montealegre; Ivan Rapaport,"One of the most basic techniques in algorithm design consists of breaking a problem into subproblems and then proceeding recursively. In the case of graph algorithms, one way to implement this approach is through separator sets. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a subset of nodes $S \subseteq V$ is called a separator set of $G$ if the size of each connected component of $G-S$ is at most $2/3 \cdot |V|$. The most useful separator sets are those that satisfy certain restrictions of cardinality or structure. For over 40 years, various efficient algorithms have been developed for computing separators of different kinds, particularly in planar graphs. Separator sets, combined with a divide and conquer approach, have been fundamental in the design of efficient algorithms in various settings.  In this work, we present the first deterministic algorithm in the distributed CONGEST model that recursively computes a cycle separator over planar graphs in $\tilde{O}(D)$ rounds. This result, as in the centralized setting, has significant implications in the area of distributed planar algorithms. In fact, from this result, we can construct a deterministic algorithm that computes a DFS tree in ${\tilde{O}}(D)$ rounds. This matches both the best-known randomized algorithm of Ghaffari and Parter (DISC, 2017) and, up to polylogarithmic factors, the trivial lower bound of $\Omega(D)$ rounds.",2025-04-30,2025-04-30,cs.DC,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21620v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21620v1,,,DISC,2024,cs.DC,2025-09-09T07:38:03.313995
2503.16216v1,Dispersion is (Almost) Optimal under (A)synchrony,Ajay D. Kshemkalyani; Manish Kumar; Anisur Rahaman Molla; Gokarna Sharma,"The dispersion problem has received much attention recently in the distributed computing literature. In this problem, $k\leq n$ agents placed initially arbitrarily on the nodes of an $n$-node, $m$-edge anonymous graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ have to reposition autonomously to reach a configuration in which each agent is on a distinct node of the graph. Dispersion is interesting as well as important due to its connections to many fundamental coordination problems by mobile agents on graphs, such as exploration, scattering, load balancing, relocation of self-driven electric cars (robots) to recharge stations (nodes), etc. The objective has been to provide a solution that optimizes simultaneously time and memory complexities. There exist graphs for which the lower bound on time complexity is $\Omega(k)$. Memory complexity is $\Omega(\log k)$ per agent independent of graph topology. The state-of-the-art algorithms have (i) time complexity $O(k\log^2k)$ and memory complexity $O(\log(k+\Delta))$ under the synchronous setting [DISC'24] and (ii) time complexity $O(\min\{m,k\Delta\})$ and memory complexity $O(\log(k+\Delta))$ under the asynchronous setting [OPODIS'21]. In this paper, we improve substantially on this state-of-the-art. Under the synchronous setting as in [DISC'24], we present the first optimal $O(k)$ time algorithm keeping memory complexity $O(\log (k+\Delta))$. Under the asynchronous setting as in [OPODIS'21], we present the first algorithm with time complexity $O(k\log k)$ keeping memory complexity $O(\log (k+\Delta))$, which is time-optimal within an $O(\log k)$ factor despite asynchrony.

We present a new reduction from multivalued BA to binary BA. It allows one to achieve BA on $\ell$-bit inputs with one instance of binary BA, one instance of crusader agreement (CA) on $\ell$-bit inputs and $\Theta(\ell n + n^2)$ bits of additional communication.  As our reduction uses multivalued CA, we also design two new information-theoretic CA protocols for $\ell$-bit inputs. In the first one, we use almost-universal hashing to achieve statistical security with probability $1 - 2^{-\lambda}$ against $t < \frac{n}{3}$ faults with $\Theta(\ell n + n^2(\lambda + \log n))$ bits of communication. Following this, we replace the hashes with error correcting code symbols and add a preliminary step based on the synchronous multivalued BA protocol COOL [DISC '21] to obtain a second, perfectly secure CA protocol that can for any $\varepsilon > 0$ be set to tolerate $t \leq \frac{n}{3 + \varepsilon}$ faults with $\mathcal{O}\bigl(\frac{\ell n}{\min(1, \varepsilon^2)} + n^2\max\bigl(1, \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\bigr) \bigr)$ bits of communication.

Our focus is on the geometric version of the problem, where robots are positioned in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and once activated, a robot can move at a constant speed to wake up others. The objective is to minimize the time it takes to activate the last robot, also known as the makespan.  We present new upper bounds for the $l_1$ and $l_2$ norms in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. For $(\mathbb{R}^2, l_2)$, we achieve a makespan of at most $5.4162r$, improving on the previous bound of $7.07r$ by Bonichon et al. (DISC'24). In $(\mathbb{R}^3, l_1)$, we establish an upper bound of $13r$, which leads to a bound of $22.52r$ for $(\mathbb{R}^3, l_2)$.

Dor, Halperin and Zwick [FOCS'96, SICOMP'00] had two algorithms for the commensurate unweighted $+2\cdot\left( k+1\right)$-APASP: $\tilde O\left(n^{2-\frac{1}{k+2}}m^{\frac{1}{k+2}}\right)$ runtime for sparse graphs and $\tilde O\left(n^{2+\frac{1}{3k+2}}\right)$ runtime for dense graphs. Cohen and Zwick [SODA'97, JALG'01] adapted the sparse variant to weighted graphs: $+2\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}{W_i}$-APASP algorithm in the same runtime. We show an algorithm for dense weighted graphs.  For \emph{nearly additive} APASP, we present a $\left(1+\varepsilon,\min{\left\{2W_1,4W_{2}\right\}}\right)$-APASP algorithm with $\tilde O\left(\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)^{O\left(1\right)}\cdot n^{2.15135313}\cdot\log W\right)$ runtime.

Its generalization, the Multi-Path TSP, has recently been used in the best known algorithm for path TSP by Traub and Vygen [Cambridge University Press, 2024]. The best known approximation factor for this problem is $2.214$ by B\""{o}hm, Friggstad, M\""{o}mke and Spoerhase [SODA 2025]. In this paper we show that for the case of graphic metrics, a significantly better approximation guarantee of $2$ can be attained. Our algorithm is based on sampling paths from a decomposition of the flow corresponding to the optimal solution to the LP for the problem, and connecting the left-out vertices with doubled edges. The cost of the latter is twice the optimum in the worst case; we show how the cost of the sampled paths can be absorbed into it without increasing the approximation factor. Furthermore, we prove that any below-$2$ approximation algorithm for the special case of the problem where each source is the same as the corresponding sink yields a below-$2$ approximation algorithm for Graphic Multi-Path TSP.  We also show that our ideas can be utilized to give a factor $1.791$-approximation algorithm for Ordered TSP in graphic metrics, for which the aforementioned paper [SODA 2025] and Armbruster, Mnich and N\""agele [APPROX 2024] give a $1.868$-approximation algorithm in general metrics.",2025-08-30,2025-08-30,"cs.DS, 68R05 (Primary), 90C27 (Secondary), F.2.2; G.2.1; E.1",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00448v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00448v1,,,SODA,2024,cs.DS,2025-09-09T07:38:10.325632

In most regimes, our algorithm improves significantly over the previously fastest algorithm for the problem [Chen, Meierhans, Probst Gutenberg, Saranurak; SODA 25]. Additionally, our result generalizes to $k$-way conductance.  We obtain these results, by approximating the eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix $L:=I-\rm{Deg}^{-1/2}A\rm{Deg}^ {-1/2}$, where, $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $\rm{Deg}$ is the diagonal matrix with the weighted degrees on the diagonal. The previous state of the art sparsest cut algorithm is in the technical realm of expander decompositions. Our algorithms, on the other hand, are relatively simple and easy to implement. At the core, they rely on the well-known power method, which comes down to repeatedly multiplying the Laplacian with a vector. This operation can be performed in a single round in the CONGEST model.

2508.16389v1,Going Beyond Twin-width? CSPs with Unbounded Domain and Few Variables,Peter Jonsson; Victor Lagerkvist; Jorke M. de Vlas; Magnus WahlstrÃ¶m,"We study a model of constraint satisfaction problems geared towards instances with few variables but with domain of unbounded size (udCSP). Our model is inspired by recent work on FPT algorithms for MinCSP where frequently both upper and lower bounds on the parameterized complexity of a problem correspond to $k$-variable udCSPs; e.g., the FPT algorithms for Boolean MinCSP (Kim et al., SODA 2023) and Directed Multicut with three cut requests (Hatzel et al., SODA 2023) both reduce to k-variable udCSPs, and the canonical W[1]-hardness construction in the area, Paired Min Cut by Marx and Razgon (IPL 2009), is effectively a k-variable udCSP.  The udCSP framework represents constraints with unbounded domains via a collection $\mathcal{M}$ of unary maps into a finite-domain base language $\Gamma$. We develop an algebraic theory for studying the complexity of udCSP$(\Gamma,\mathcal{M})$ with a Galois connection based on partial multifunctions.  We study three types of maps: unrestricted, one-hot, and monotone. For unrestricted maps, the problem is W[1]-hard for all but trivial cases, and for one-hot maps, the characterization coincides with Marx' FPT dichotomy for Boolean Weighted CSPs (Computational Complexity 2005). For the case of monotone maps Mo, we show that the complexity depends on restricted identifies we call ordered polymorphisms; we identify the ""connector"" polymorphism as the likely FPT boundary. We show that its absence implies that udCSP($\Gamma$,Mo) defines all permutations, and the problem is W[1]-hard; while its presence for a binary language implies bounded twin-width, and the problem is FPT (Twin-Width IV; Bonnet et al., JACM 2024). For non-binary languages, where twin-width does not apply, the polymorphism coincides with a notion of bounded projected grid-rank; however, we leave the FPT question for this case open.",2025-08-22,2025-08-22,"cs.DS, cs.CC",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16389v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16389v1,,,SODA,2024,cs.DS,2025-09-09T07:38:10.325681

Previously, Aamand {\em et al.} (SODA 2023) gave a deterministic $2^{\sqrt{\log n} \sqrt{\log \log n + \log (1/\varepsilon)}}$-competitive algorithm when $m = (1+\varepsilon) n$ for any $\varepsilon \ge \Omega(\log n/n)$. They also showed a lower bound: with $m = \gamma n$ space, the competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm is at least $\frac{1}{\gamma}\cdot\Omega(\log n / \log \log n)$. This left an exponential gap between the upper and lower bounds for the problem.  In this paper, we bridge this exponential gap and almost completely resolve the online sorting problem. First, we give a deterministic $O(\log^2 n / \varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm with $m = (1+\varepsilon) n$, for any $\varepsilon \ge \Omega(\log n / n)$. Next, for $m = \gamma n$ where $\gamma = [O(1), O(\log^2 n)]$, we give a deterministic $O(\log^2 n / \gamma)$-competitive algorithm. In particular, this implies an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm with $O(n \log^2 n)$ space, which is within an $O(\log n\cdot \log \log n)$ factor of the lower bound of $\Omega(n \log n / \log \log n)$. Combined, the two results imply a close to optimal tradeoff between space and competitive ratio for the entire range of interest: specifically, an upper bound of $O(\log^2 n)$ on the product of the competitive ratio and $\gamma$ while the lower bound on this product is $\Omega(\log n / \log\log n)$.

This substantially improves on prior deterministic algorithms for output-sparse matrix multiplication.  Our second, randomized algorithm for OSMM works via a reduction to compressed sensing and a variant of matrix multiplication verification, and runs in roughly $n^{\omega(\delta - 1, 1, 1)}$ time. This algorithm and its extension to the fully sparse setting have running times that match those of the (randomized) algorithms for OSMM and FSMM, respectively, in recent work of Abboud, Bringmann, Fischer, and K\""{u}nnemann (SODA, 2024).

Despite the intuition that the stochastic version should yield much better cost bounds, the previous best algorithm for stochastic online sorting by Abrahamsen, Bercea, Beretta, Klausen and Kozma (ESA 2024) only achieves $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ cost, which seems far from optimal. We show that stochastic online sorting indeed allows for much more efficient algorithms, by presenting an algorithm that achieves expected cost $\log n\cdot 2^{O(\log^* n)}$. We also prove a cost lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$, thus show that our algorithm is nearly optimal.",2025-08-11,2025-08-12,cs.DS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07823v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07823v2,,,SODA,2024,cs.DS,2025-09-09T07:38:10.325820

The discrete Fr\'echet distance $d_{dF}(x,y)$ is a distance measure between two time series $x$ and $y$ of possibly different complexity. Given a set of $n$ time series represented as $m$-dimensional vectors over the reals, the $(k,\ell)$-median problem under discrete Fr\'echet distance aims to find a set $C$ of $k$ time series of complexity $\ell$ such that $$\sum_{x\in P} \min_{c\in C} d_{dF}(x,c)$$ is minimized. In this paper, we give the first near-linear time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for this problem when $\ell$ and $\varepsilon$ are constants but $k$ can be as large as $\Omega(n)$. We obtain our result by introducing a new dimension reduction technique for discrete Fr\'echet distance and then adapt an algorithm of Cohen-Addad et al. (J. ACM 2021) to work on the dimension-reduced input. As a byproduct we also improve the best coreset construction for $(k,\ell)$-median under discrete Fr\'echet distance (Cohen-Addad et al., SODA 2025) and show that its size can be independent of the number of input time series \emph{ and } their complexity.",2025-08-09,2025-08-09,cs.DS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07008v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07008v1,,,SODA,2024,cs.DS,2025-09-09T07:38:10.325855

2509.05871v1,A General Framework for Low Soundness Homomorphism Testing,Tushant Mittal; Sourya Roy,"We introduce a general framework to design and analyze algorithms for the problem of testing homomorphisms between finite groups in the low-soundness regime.  In this regime, we give the first constant-query tests for various families of groups. These include tests for: (i) homomorphisms between arbitrary cyclic groups, (ii) homomorphisms between any finite group and $\mathbb{Z}_p$, (iii) automorphisms of dihedral and symmetric groups, (iv) inner automorphisms of non-abelian finite simple groups and extraspecial groups, and (v) testing linear characters of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, and finite-dimensional Lie algebras over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also recover the result of Kiwi [TCS'03] for testing homomorphisms between $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ and $\mathbb{F}_q$.  Prior to this work, such tests were only known for abelian groups with a constant maximal order (such as $\mathbb{F}_q^n$). No tests were known for non-abelian groups.  As an additional corollary, our framework gives combinatorial list decoding bounds for cyclic groups with list size dependence of $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (for agreement parameter $\varepsilon$). This improves upon the currently best-known bound of $O(\varepsilon^{-105})$ due to Dinur, Grigorescu, Kopparty, and Sudan [STOC'08], and Guo and Sudan [RANDOM'14].",2025-09-07,2025-09-07,"cs.CC, cs.DS, math.CO",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05871v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05871v1,,,STOC,2024,cs.DS,2025-09-09T07:38:17.688837
2509.00890v1,New approximate distance oracles and their applications,Avi Kadria; Liam Roditty,"Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and let $\mu = m/n$. A \emph{distance oracle} is a data structure designed to answer approximate distance queries, with the goal of achieving low stretch, efficient space usage, and fast query time. While much of the prior work focused on distance oracles with constant query time, this paper presents a comprehensive study of distance oracles with non-constant query time. We explore the tradeoffs between space, stretch, and query time of distance oracles in various regimes. Specifically, we consider both weighted and unweighted graphs in the regimes of stretch $< 2$ and stretch $\ge 2$. Among our results, we present a new three-way trade-off between stretch, space, and query time, offering a natural extension of the classical Thorup-Zwick distance oracle [STOC'01 and JACM'05] to regimes with larger query time. Specifically, for any $0 < r < 1/2$ and integer $k \ge 1$, we construct a $(2k(1 - 2r) - 1)$-stretch distance oracle with $\tilde{O}(m + n^{1 + 1/k})$ space and $\tilde{O}(\mu n^r)$ query time. In addition, we demonstrate several applications of our new distance oracles to the $n$-Pairs Shortest Paths ($n$-PSP) problem and the All Nodes Shortest Cycles ($ANSC$) problem.",2025-08-31,2025-08-31,cs.DS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00890v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00890v1,,,STOC,2024,cs.DS,2025-09-09T07:38:17.688872
2508.08078v1,Sparsifying Cayley Graphs on Every Group,Jun-Ting Hsieh; Daniel Z. Lee; Sidhanth Mohanty; Aaron Putterman; Rachel Yun Zhang,"A classic result in graph theory, due to Batson, Spielman, and Srivastava (STOC 2009) shows that every graph admits a $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$ cut (or spectral) sparsifier which preserves only $O(n / \varepsilon^2)$ reweighted edges. However, when applying this result to \emph{Cayley graphs}, the resulting sparsifier is no longer necessarily a Cayley graph -- it can be an arbitrary subset of edges.  Thus, a recent line of inquiry, and one which has only seen minor progress, asks: for any group $G$, do all Cayley graphs over the group $G$ admit sparsifiers which preserve only $\mathrm{polylog}(|G|)/\varepsilon^2$ many re-weighted generators?  As our primary contribution, we answer this question in the affirmative, presenting a proof of the existence of such Cayley graph spectral sparsifiers, along with an efficient algorithm for finding them. Our algorithm even extends to \emph{directed} Cayley graphs, if we instead ask only for cut sparsification instead of spectral sparsification.  We additionally study the sparsification of linear equations over non-abelian groups. In contrast to the abelian case, we show that for non-abelian valued equations, super-polynomially many linear equations must be preserved in order to approximately preserve the number of satisfied equations for any input. Together with our Cayley graph sparsification result, this provides a formal separation between Cayley graph sparsification and sparsifying linear equations.",2025-08-11,2025-08-11,"cs.DS, math.CO",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08078v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08078v1,,,STOC,2024,cs.DS,2025-09-09T07:38:17.688900
2508.06486v1,Does block size matter in randomized block Krylov low-rank  approximation?,Tyler Chen; Ethan N. Epperly; Raphael A. Meyer; Christopher Musco; Akash Rao,"We study the problem of computing a rank-$k$ approximation of a matrix using randomized block Krylov iteration. Prior work has shown that, for block size $b = 1$ or $b = k$, a $(1 + \varepsilon)$-factor approximation to the best rank-$k$ approximation can be obtained after $\tilde O(k/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ matrix-vector products with the target matrix. On the other hand, when $b$ is between $1$ and $k$, the best known bound on the number of matrix-vector products scales with $b(k-b)$, which could be as large as $O(k^2)$. Nevertheless, in practice, the performance of block Krylov methods is often optimized by choosing a block size $1 \ll b \ll k$. We resolve this theory-practice gap by proving that randomized block Krylov iteration produces a $(1 + \varepsilon)$-factor approximate rank-$k$ approximation using $\tilde O(k/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ matrix-vector products for any block size $1\le b\le k$. Our analysis relies on new bounds for the minimum singular value of a random block Krylov matrix, which may be of independent interest. Similar bounds are central to recent breakthroughs on faster algorithms for sparse linear systems [Peng & Vempala, SODA 2021; Nie, STOC 2022].",2025-08-08,2025-08-08,"cs.DS, cs.NA, math.NA, 65F55 65F15, G.1.3; F.2.1",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06486v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06486v1,,,STOC,2024,cs.DS,2025-09-09T07:38:17.688926
2508.03930v2,Counting Distinct Square Substrings in Sublinear Time,Panagiotis Charalampopoulos; Manal Mohamed; Jakub Radoszewski; Wojciech Rytter; Tomasz WaleÅ; Wiktor Zuba,"We show that the number of distinct squares in a packed string of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$ can be computed in $O(n/\log_\sigma n)$ time in the word-RAM model. This paper is the first to introduce a sublinear-time algorithm for counting squares in the packed setting. The packed representation of a string of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$ is given as a sequence of $O(n/\log_\sigma n)$ machine words in the word-RAM model (a machine word consists of $\omega \ge \log_2 n$ bits). Previously, it was known how to count distinct squares in $O(n)$ time [Gusfield and Stoye, JCSS 2004], even for a string over an integer alphabet [Crochemore et al., TCS 2014; Bannai et al., CPM 2017; Charalampopoulos et al., SPIRE 2020]. We use the techniques for extracting squares from runs described by Crochemore et al. [TCS 2014]. However, the packed model requires novel approaches.  We need an $O(n/\log_\sigma n)$-sized representation of all long-period runs (runs with period $\Omega(\log_\sigma n)$) which allows for a sublinear-time counting of the -- potentially linearly-many -- implied squares. The long-period runs with a string period that is periodic itself (called layer runs) are an obstacle, since their number can be $\Omega(n)$. The number of all other long-period runs is $O(n/\log_\sigma n)$ and we can construct an implicit representation of all long-period runs in $O(n/\log_\sigma n)$ time by leveraging the insights of Amir et al. [ESA 2019]. We count squares in layer runs by exploiting combinatorial properties of pyramidally-shaped groups of layer runs. Another difficulty lies in computing the locations of Lyndon roots of runs in packed strings, which is needed for grouping runs that may generate equal squares. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce sparse-Lyndon roots which are based on string synchronizers [Kempa and Kociumaka, STOC 2019].",2025-08-05,2025-09-02,cs.DS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03930v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03930v2,,,STOC,2024,cs.DS,2025-09-09T07:38:17.688955
2508.02825v1,Finding Colorings in One-Sided Expanders,Rares-Darius Buhai; Yiding Hua; David Steurer; Andor VÃ¡ri-Kakas,"We establish new algorithmic guarantees with matching hardness results for coloring and independent set problems in one-sided expanders and related classes of graphs. For example, given a $3$-colorable regular one-sided expander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative size at least $1/2-o(1)$ or a proper $3$-coloring for all but an $o(1)$ fraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to $0$ with the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This result improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025) developing an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative size at least $0.01$ in such graphs. We also obtain an efficient $1.6667$-factor approximation algorithm for VERTEX COVER in sufficiently strong regular one-sided expanders, improving over a previous $(2-\epsilon)$-factor approximation in such graphs for an unspecified constant $\epsilon>0$.  We propose a new stratification of $k$-COLORING in terms of $k$-by-$k$ matrices akin to predicate sets for constraint satisfaction problems. We prove that whenever this matrix has repeated rows, the corresponding coloring problem is NP-hard for one-sided expanders under the Unique Games Conjecture. On the other hand, if this matrix has no repeated rows, our algorithms can solve the corresponding coloring problem on one-sided expanders in polynomial time.  As starting point for our algorithmic results, we show a property of graph spectra that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before: The number of negative eigenvalues smaller than $-\tau$ is at most $O(1/\tau^{2})$ times the number of eigenvalues larger than $\tau^{2}/2$. While this result allows us to bound the number of eigenvalues bounded away from $0$ in one-sided spectral expanders, this property alone is insufficient for our algorithmic results.",2025-08-04,2025-08-04,cs.DS,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02825v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02825v1,,,STOC,2024,cs.DS,2025-09-09T07:38:17.688983
2508.01762v1,Faster Distributed $Î$-Coloring via a Reduction to MIS,Yann Bourreau; Sebastian Brandt; Alexandre Nolin,"Recent improvements on the deterministic complexities of fundamental graph problems in the LOCAL model of distributed computing have yielded state-of-the-art upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds for maximal independent set (MIS) and $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring [Ghaffari, Grunau, FOCS'24] and $\tilde{O}(\log^{19/9} n)$ rounds for the more restrictive $\Delta$-coloring problem [Ghaffari, Kuhn, FOCS'21; Ghaffari, Grunau, FOCS'24; Bourreau, Brandt, Nolin, STOC'25]. In our work, we show that $\Delta$-coloring can be solved deterministically in $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} n)$ rounds as well, matching the currently best bound for $(\Delta + 1)$-coloring.  We achieve our result by developing a reduction from $\Delta$-coloring to MIS that guarantees that the (asymptotic) complexity of $\Delta$-coloring is at most the complexity of MIS, unless MIS can be solved in sublogarithmic time, in which case, due to the $\Omega(\log n)$-round $\Delta$-coloring lower bound from [BFHKLRSU, STOC'16], our reduction implies a tight complexity of $\Theta(\log n)$ for $\Delta$-coloring. In particular, any improvement on the complexity of the MIS problem will yield the same improvement for the complexity of $\Delta$-coloring (up to the true complexity of $\Delta$-coloring).  Our reduction yields improvements for $\Delta$-coloring in the randomized LOCAL model and when complexities are parameterized by both $n$ and $\Delta$. We obtain a randomized complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(\log^{5/3} \log n)$ rounds (improving over the state of the art of $\tilde{O}(\log^{8/3} \log n)$ rounds) on general graphs and tight complexities of $\Theta(\log n)$ and $\Theta(\log \log n)$ for the deterministic, resp.\ randomized, complexity on bounded-degree graphs.

2508.01257v1,PageRank Centrality in Directed Graphs with Bounded In-Degree,Mikkel Thorup; Hanzhi Wang; Zhewei Wei; Mingji Yang,"We study the computational complexity of locally estimating a node's PageRank centrality in a directed graph $G$. For any node $t$, its PageRank centrality $\pi(t)$ is defined as the probability that a random walk in $G$, starting from a uniformly chosen node, terminates at $t$, where each step terminates with a constant probability $\alpha\in(0,1)$.  To obtain a multiplicative $\big(1\pm O(1)\big)$-approximation of $\pi(t)$ with probability $\Omega(1)$, the previously best upper bound is $O(n^{1/2}\min\{ \Delta_{in}^{1/2},\Delta_{out}^{1/2},m^{1/4}\})$ from [Wang, Wei, Wen, Yang STOC '24], where $n$ and $m$ denote the number of nodes and edges in $G$, and $\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ upper bound the in-degrees and out-degrees of $G$, respectively. The same paper implicitly gives the previously best lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/2}\min\{\Delta_{in}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},\Delta_{out}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},m^{1/4}\})$, where $\gamma=\frac{\log(1/(1-\alpha))}{4\log\Delta_{in}-2\log(1/(1-\alpha))}$ if $\Delta_{in}>1/(1-\alpha)$, and $\gamma=1/2$ if $\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$. As $\gamma$ only depends on $\Delta_{in}$, the known upper bound is tight if we only parameterize the complexity by $n$, $m$, and $\Delta_{out}$. However, there remains a gap of $\Omega(n^{\gamma})$ when considering $\Delta_{in}$, and this gap is large when $\Delta_{in}$ is small. In the extreme case where $\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$, we have $\gamma=1/2$, leading to a gap of $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ between the bounds $O(n^{1/2})$ and $\Omega(1)$.  In this paper, we present a new algorithm that achieves the above lower bound (up to logarithmic factors). The algorithm assumes that $n$ and the bounds $\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ are known in advance.

Here, we improve these lower bounds in certain cases via a more streamlined reduction to XOR refutation, coupled with handling the odd-arity case. Our result can be viewed as a complete derandomization of the state-of-the-art semi-random $k$-XOR refutation analysis (Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar, STOC 2022, Hsieh, Kothari and Mohanty, SODA 2023), which complements the derandomization of the even-arity case obtained by Korten et al.  As our main technical statement, we show that for any multi-output constant-depth circuit that substantially stretches its input, its output is very likely far from strings sampled from distributions with sufficient independence, and further this can be efficiently certified.

We present an investigation into how the community's citations to milestones have evolved over 43 years of CHI Proceedings (1981-2024). Forgetting curves plotted for each year suggest that milestones are slowly fading from the CHI community's collective memory. However, the picture is more nuanced when we trace citations to the top-cited milestones over time.

Previous studies have mostly addressed the technical aspects of telepathology and general pathology consultation. In this study, we focus on our experience at University of Texas Health-McGovern Medical School in Houston, Texas in providing hematopathology consultation to the Pathology Department at Ho Chi Minh City Oncology Hospital in Vietnam. Over a 32-month period, 71 hematopathology cases were submitted for telepathology. Diagnostic efficiency significantly improved with average turnaround times reduced by 30% compared to traditional on-site consultations with local pathologists using glass slides. A web site has been established in this telepathology project to retain information of the most recently discussed cases for further review after the teleconference. Telepathology provides an effective platform for real-time consultations, allowing remote subspecialty experts to interact with local pathologists for comprehensive case reviews.

In this paper, we present the early phases of an AI tool we created called KITSUNE, which supports authors in placing their work into the format of a CHI paper, taking into account many conventions that are ever-present in CHI papers. We describe the development of the tool with the intent to promote discussion around how writing conventions are upheld and unquestioned by the CHI community, and how this translates to the work produced.

We may need a super power -- or super method -- from another world. I outline three motivations for jump-starting research synthesis in games user research. I argue that: research synthesis will validate this field of study and enrich primary research (meta-scholarship); we must level up both primary and secondary research (education); and we should reflect this epistemological stance in community structures and adopt established tools and protocols (standardization).

Unlike status-quo touch interaction -- a shadowplay of fingers on a single screen -- I argue that our perspective of direct interaction should encompass the full rich context of individual use (whether via touch, sensors, or in combination with other modalities), as well as collaborative activity where people are engaged in local (co-located), remote (tele-present), and hybrid work. We can further view touch through the lens of the ""Society of Devices,"" where each person's activities span many complementary, oft-distinct devices that offer the right task affordance (input modality, screen size, aspect ratio, or simply a distinct surface with dedicated purpose) at the right place and time. While many hints of this vision already exist (see references), I speculate that a comprehensive program of research to systematically inventory, sense, and design interactions around such human behaviors and activities -- and that fully embrace touch as a multi-modal, multi-sensor, multi-user, and multi-device construct -- could revolutionize both individual and collaborative interaction with technology.",2023-10-06,2023-10-06,"cs.HC, H.5.2",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03958v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03958v1,,,UIST,2024,cs.HC,2025-09-09T07:38:24.750972

Cognition models have been used to understand the role of attention and individual preferences and beliefs on human decision making during interaction, while biomechanical simulations have been successfully applied to analyse and predict physical effort, fatigue, and discomfort. The next frontier in HCI lies in connecting these models to enable robust, diverse, and representative simulations of different user groups. These embodied user simulations could predict user intents, strategies, and movements during interaction more accurately, benchmark interfaces and interaction techniques in terms of performance and ergonomics, and guide adaptive system design. This UIST workshop explores ideas for integrating computational models into HCI and discusses use cases such as UI/UX design, automated system testing, and personalised adaptive interfaces.

The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective is crucial for this analysis, as it uniquely reveals the interaction dynamics and specific control mechanisms that dictate how agency manifests in practice. Despite this importance, a systematic synthesis mapping agency configurations and control mechanisms within the HCI/CSCW literature is lacking. Addressing this gap, we reviewed 134 papers from top-tier HCI/CSCW venues (e.g., CHI, UIST, CSCW) over the past 20 years. This review yields four primary contributions: (1) an integrated theoretical framework structuring agency patterns, control mechanisms, and interaction contexts, (2) a comprehensive operational catalog of control mechanisms detailing how agency is implemented; (3) an actionable cross-context map linking agency configurations to diverse co-creative practices; and (4) grounded implications and guidance for future CSCW research and the design of co-creative systems, addressing aspects like trust and ethics.",2025-07-08,2025-07-08,cs.HC,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06000v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06000v1,,,UIST,2024,cs.HC,2025-09-09T07:38:28.360638

Unfortunately, experimental design plans can be difficult to specify, communicate clearly, and relate to alternatives. In response, we introduce a grammar of experimental design that provides composable operators for constructing assignment procedures (e.g., Latin square). We implement this grammar in PLanet, a domain-specific language (DSL) that constructs assignment plans in three stages: experimental unit specification, trial-order construction, and order-to-unit mapping. We evaluate PLanet's expressivity by taking a purposive sample of recent CHI and UIST publications, representing their experiments as programs in PLanet, and identifying ambiguities and alternatives. In our evaluation, PLanet could express 11 out of 12 experiments found in sampled papers. Additionally, we found that PLanet constructs helped make complex design choices explicit when the researchers omit technical language describing their study designs.",2025-05-14,2025-05-14,cs.HC,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09094v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09094v1,,,UIST,2024,cs.HC,2025-09-09T07:38:28.360662

Spatial computing enables interaction with virtual elements through natural input methods such as eye tracking, hand gestures, and voice commands, thus placing natural human-computer interaction at its core. While previous surveys have reviewed conventional XR interaction techniques, recent advancements in natural interaction, particularly driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), have introduced new paradigms and technologies. In this paper, we review research on multimodal natural interaction for wearable XR, focusing on papers published between 2022 and 2024 in six top venues: ACM CHI, UIST, IMWUT (Ubicomp), IEEE VR, ISMAR, and TVCG. We classify and analyze these studies based on application scenarios, operation types, and interaction modalities. This analysis provides a structured framework for understanding how researchers are designing advanced natural interaction techniques in XR.

Prior research has leveraged such approaches, what we call beyond-real techniques, to make interactions in VR more practical, efficient, ergonomic, and accessible. We present a survey categorizing prior movement-based VR interaction literature as reality-based, illusory, or beyond-real interactions. We survey relevant conferences (CHI, IEEE VR, VRST, UIST, and DIS) while focusing on selection, manipulation, locomotion, and navigation in VR. For beyond-real interactions, we describe the transformations that have been used by prior works to create novel remappings.

Our goal is to provide guidance for future evaluations of MR/AR approaches. To this end, we characterize publications by paper type (e.g., technique, design study), research topic (e.g., tracking, rendering), evaluation scenario (e.g., algorithm performance, user performance), cognitive aspects (e.g., perception, emotion), and the context in which evaluations were conducted (e.g., lab vs. in-the-wild). We found a strong coupling of types, topics, and scenarios. We observe two groups: (a) technology-centric performance evaluations of algorithms that focus on improving tracking, displays, reconstruction, rendering, and calibration, and (b) human-centric studies that analyze implications of applications and design, human factors on perception, usability, decision making, emotion, and attention. Amongst the 458 papers, we identified 248 user studies that involved 5,761 participants in total, of whom only 1,619 were identified as female. We identified 43 data collection methods used to analyze 10 cognitive aspects. We found nine objective methods, and eight methods that support qualitative analysis.

The challenge addresses the growing need for reliable predictions within the boundaries of a shopping session, as customer intentions can be different depending on the occasion. The need for efficient procedures for personalization is even clearer if we consider the e-commerce landscape more broadly: outside of giant digital retailers, the constraints of the problem are stricter, due to smaller user bases and the realization that most users are not frequently returning customers. We release a new session-based dataset including more than 30M fine-grained browsing events (product detail, add, purchase), enriched by linguistic behavior (queries made by shoppers, with items clicked and items not clicked after the query) and catalog meta-data (images, text, pricing information). On this dataset, we ask participants to showcase innovative solutions for two open problems: a recommendation task (where a model is shown some events at the start of a session, and it is asked to predict future product interactions); an intent prediction task, where a model is shown a session containing an add-to-cart event, and it is asked to predict whether the item will be bought before the end of the session.",2021-04-19,2021-07-16,cs.IR,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09423v4,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09423v4,,,SIGIR,2024,cs.IR,2025-09-09T07:38:31.899709

To provide additional contextual information about individuals and relations we supplement the data provided as part of the WSDM 2017 Triple Score contest with Wikidata and DBpedia, two large-scale knowledge graphs (KG). Our hypothesis is that any type relation, i.e., a specific profession like 'actor' or 'scientist,' can be described by the set of typical ""activities"" of people known to have that type relation. For example, actors are known to star in movies, and scientists are known for their academic affiliations. In a KG, this information is to be found on a properly defined subset of the second-degree neighbors of the type relation. This form of local information can be used as part of a learning algorithm to predict relevance scores for new, unseen triples. When scoring 'profession' and 'nationality' triples our experiments based on this approach result in an accuracy equal to 73% and 78%, respectively.

The generated similarity score can then be used to rank the multiple values associated with this subject.

For example, consider Julius Caesar who has had various professions, including Politician and Author. For two given triples (Julius Caesar, profession, Politician) and (Julius Caesar, profession, Author), the former triple is likely to have a higher relevance score (also called ""triple score"") because Julius Caesar was well-known as a politician and not as an author. Accurate prediction of such triple scores greatly benefits real-world applications, such as information retrieval or knowledge base query. In these scenarios, being able to rank all relations (Profession/Nationality) can help improve the user experience. We propose a triple scoring model which integrates knowledge from both latent features and explicit features via an ensemble approach. The latent features consist of representations for a person learned by using a word2vec model and representations for profession/nationality values extracted from a pre-trained GloVe embedding model. In addition, we extract explicit features for person entities from the Freebase knowledge base.

Over the last years, researchers have developed innovative optical switching technologies that enable reconfigurable datacenter networks (RCDNs) which support very fast topology reconfigurations. This paper presents D3, a novel and feasible RDCN architecture that improves throughput and flow completion time. D3 quickly and jointly adapts its links and packet scheduling toward the evolving demand, combining both demand-oblivious and demand-aware behaviors when needed. D3 relies on a decentralized network control plane supporting greedy, integrated-multihop, IP-based routing, allowing to react, quickly and locally, to topological changes without overheads. A rack-local synchronization and transport layer further support fast network adjustments. Moreover, we argue that D3 can be implemented using the recently proposed Sirius architecture (SIGCOMM 2020). We report on an extensive empirical evaluation using packet-level simulations. We find that D3 improves throughput by up to 15% and preserves competitive flow completion times compared to the state of the art.

Dynamically reconfigurable topologies, e.g., based on optical circuit switches, are emerging as an innovative new technology to deal with the explosive growth of datacenter traffic. Specifically, \emph{periodic} reconfigurable datacenter networks (RDCNs) such as RotorNet (SIGCOMM 2017), Opera (NSDI 2020) and Sirius (SIGCOMM 2020) have been shown to provide high throughput, by emulating a \emph{complete graph} through fast periodic circuit switch scheduling.  However, to achieve such a high throughput, existing reconfigurable network designs pay a high price: in terms of potentially high delays, but also, as we show as a first contribution in this paper, in terms of the high buffer requirements. In particular, we show that under buffer constraints, emulating the high-throughput complete graph is infeasible at scale, and we uncover a spectrum of unvisited and attractive alternative RDCNs, which emulate regular graphs, but with lower node degree than the complete graph.  We present Mars, a periodic reconfigurable topology which emulates a $d$-regular graph with near-optimal throughput. In particular, we systematically analyze how the degree~$d$ can be optimized for throughput given the available buffer and delay tolerance of the datacenter. We further show empirically that Mars achieves higher throughput compared to existing systems when buffer sizes are bounded.",2022-04-06,2022-12-28,cs.NI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.02525v3,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02525v3,,,SIGCOMM,2024,cs.NI,2025-09-09T07:38:42.970916

In this context, leveraging the densely deployed 5G base stations (BS) for radar sensing is particularly promising, offering both wide coverage and immediate feedback to 5G scheduling. However, the targeting radar signals are superimposed with concurrent 5G uplink transmissions received by the BS, and practical deployment also demands a lightweight, portable radar sensing model. This paper presents BatStation, a lightweight, in-situ radar sensing framework seamlessly integrated into 5G BSs. BatStation leverages uplink resource grids to extract radar signals through three key components: (i) radar signal separation to cancel concurrent 5G transmissions and reveal the radar signals, (ii) resource grid reshaping to align time-frequency resolution with radar pulse characteristics, and (iii) zero-shot template correlation based on a portable model trained purely on synthetic data that supports detection, classification, and localization of radar pulses without fine-tuning using experimental data. We implement BatStation on a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed and evaluate its performance with real 5G traffic in the CBRS band. Results show robust performance across diverse radar types, achieving detection probabilities of 97.02% (PUCCH) and 79.23% (PUSCH), classification accuracy up to 97.00%, and median localization errors of 2.68-6.20 MHz (frequency) and 24.6-32.4 microseconds (time).

However, harsh space environments make satellites vulnerable to failures, leading to node removals that disrupt inter-satellite networking. With the high risk of satellite node failures, understanding their impact on end-to-end services is essential. This study investigates the importance of individual nodes on inter-satellite networking and the resilience of mega satellite constellations against node failures. We represent the mega-satellite constellation as discrete temporal graphs and model node failure events accordingly. To quantify node importance for targeted services over time, we propose a service-aware temporal betweenness metric. Leveraging this metric, we develop an analytical framework to identify critical nodes and assess the impact of node failures. The framework takes node failure events as input and efficiently evaluates their impacts across current and subsequent time windows. Simulations on the Starlink constellation setting reveal that satellite networks inherently exhibit resilience to node failures, as their dynamic topology partially restore connectivity and mitigate the long-term impact. Furthermore, we find that the integration of rerouting mechanisms is crucial for unleashing the full resilience potential to ensure rapid recovery of inter-satellite networking.",2025-09-08,2025-09-08,cs.NI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06766v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06766v1,,,SIGCOMM,2024,cs.NI,2025-09-09T07:38:46.489638

However, the coexistence of distinct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity requirements, together with highly dynamic and heterogeneous network topologies, presents significant challenges for unified reliability modeling and resource optimization. To address these issues, we propose VariSAC, a graph neural network (GNN)-augmented deep reinforcement learning framework for assured, time-continuous connectivity in RIS-assisted, ISAC-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. Specifically, we introduce the Continuous Connectivity Ratio (CCR), a unified metric that characterizes the sustained temporal reliability of V2I connections and the probabilistic delivery guarantees of V2V links, thus unifying their continuous reliability semantics. Next, we employ a GNN with residual adapters to encode complex, high-dimensional system states, capturing spatial dependencies among vehicles, base stations (BS), and RIS nodes. These representations are then processed by a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent, which jointly optimizes channel allocation, power control, and RIS configurations to maximize CCR-driven long-term rewards.

We thus solve the all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs) that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes. Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.",2025-09-08,2025-09-08,"cs.LG, cs.NI",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06640v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06640v1,,,SIGCOMM,2024,cs.NI,2025-09-09T07:38:46.489719
2509.06639v1,Ghost Points Matter: Far-Range Vehicle Detection with a Single mmWave  Radar in Tunnel,Chenming He; Rui Xia; Chengzhen Meng; Xiaoran Fan; Dequan Wang; Haojie Ren; Jianmin Ji; Yanyong Zhang,"Vehicle detection in tunnels is crucial for traffic monitoring and accident response, yet remains underexplored. In this paper, we develop mmTunnel, a millimeter-wave radar system that achieves far-range vehicle detection in tunnels. The main challenge here is coping with ghost points caused by multi-path reflections, which lead to severe localization errors and false alarms. Instead of merely removing ghost points, we propose correcting them to true vehicle positions by recovering their signal reflection paths, thus reserving more data points and improving detection performance, even in occlusion scenarios. However, recovering complex 3D reflection paths from limited 2D radar points is highly challenging. To address this problem, we develop a multi-path ray tracing algorithm that leverages the ground plane constraint and identifies the most probable reflection path based on signal path loss and spatial distance. We also introduce a curve-to-plane segmentation method to simplify tunnel surface modeling such that we can significantly reduce the computational delay and achieve real-time processing.  We have evaluated mmTunnel with comprehensive experiments. In two test tunnels, we conducted controlled experiments in various scenarios with cars and trucks. Our system achieves an average F1 score of 93.7% for vehicle detection while maintaining real-time processing. Even in the challenging occlusion scenarios, the F1 score remains above 91%. Moreover, we collected extensive data from a public tunnel with heavy traffic at times and show our method could achieve an F1 score of 91.5% in real-world traffic conditions.",2025-09-08,2025-09-08,cs.NI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06639v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06639v1,,,SIGCOMM,2024,cs.NI,2025-09-09T07:38:46.489752
2509.06626v1,Network-level Censorship Attacks in the InterPlanetary File System,Jan Matter; Muoi Tran,"The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) has been successfully established as the de facto standard for decentralized data storage in the emerging Web3. Despite its decentralized nature, IPFS nodes, as well as IPFS content providers, have converged to centralization in large public clouds. Centralization introduces BGP routing-based attacks, such as passive interception and BGP hijacking, as potential threats. Although this attack vector has been investigated for many other Web3 protocols, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been analyzed for the IPFS network. In our work, we bridge this gap and demonstrate that BGP routing attacks can be effectively leveraged to censor content in IPFS. For the analysis, we collected 3,000 content blocks called CIDs and conducted a simulation of BGP hijacking and passive interception against them. We find that a single malicious AS can censor 75% of the IPFS content for more than 57% of all requester nodes. Furthermore, we show that even with a small set of only 62 hijacked prefixes, 70% of the full attack effectiveness can already be reached. We further propose and validate countermeasures based on global collaborative content replication among all nodes in the IPFS network, together with additional robust backup content provider nodes that are well-hardened against BGP hijacking. We hope this work raises awareness about the threat BGP routing-based attacks pose to IPFS and triggers further efforts to harden the live IPFS network against them.",2025-09-08,2025-09-08,"cs.CR, cs.NI",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06626v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06626v1,,,SIGCOMM,2024,cs.NI,2025-09-09T07:38:46.489777

The capacities of the servers (or the number of users with particular access restrictions) determine the sizes of the parts into which traffic should be split. A recent approach implements traffic splitting within the ternary content addressable memory (TCAM), which is often available in switches. It is important to reduce the amount of memory allocated for this task since TCAMs are power consuming and are often also required for other tasks such as classification and routing. In the longest-prefix model (LPM), Draves et al. (INFOCOM 1999) find a minimal representation of a function, and Sadeh et al. (INFOCOM 2019) find a minimal representation of a partition. In certain situations, range-functions are of special interest, that is, all the addresses with the same target, or action, are consecutive. In this paper we show that minimizing the amount of TCAM entries to represent a partition comes at the cost of fragmentation, such that for some partitions some actions must have multiple ranges. Then, we also study the case where each target must have a single segment of addresses.",2022-12-26,2022-12-26,cs.NI,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.13283v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13283v1,,,INFOCOM,2024,cs.NI,2025-09-09T07:38:53.667490

This is true in both optical wide area networks (optical WANs) and in datacenters, despite the many differences between these two settings. Because of these new technologies, there has been a surge of both practical and theoretical research on algorithms to take advantage of them. In particular, Jia et al. [INFOCOM '17] designed online scheduling algorithms for dynamically reconfigurable topologies for both the makespan and sum of completion times objectives. In this paper, we work in the same setting but study an objective that is more meaningful in an online setting: the sum of flow times. The flow time of a job is the total amount of time that it spends in the system, which may be considerably smaller than its completion time if it is released late. We provide competitive algorithms for the online setting with speed augmentation, and also give a lower bound proving that speed augmentation is in fact necessary. As a side effect of our techniques, we also improve and generalize the results of Jia et al. on completion times by giving an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for arbitrary sizes and release times even when nodes have different degree bounds, and moreover allow for the weighted sum of completion times (or flow times).",2020-01-21,2020-01-21,"cs.DS, cs.NI",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07784v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07784v1,,,INFOCOM,2024,cs.NI,2025-09-09T07:38:53.667596

1203.0732v1,Secure and Energy-Efficient Data Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks,Jaydip Sen,"Data aggregation in intermediate nodes (called aggregator nodes) is an effective approach for optimizing consumption of scarce resources like bandwidth and energy in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However, in-network processing poses a problem for the privacy of the sensor data since individual data of sensor nodes need to be known to the aggregator node before the aggregation process can be carried out. In applications of WSNs, privacy-preserving data aggregation has become an important requirement due to sensitive nature of the sensor data. Researchers have proposed a number of protocols and schemes for this purpose. He et al. (INFOCOM 2007) have proposed a protocol - called CPDA - for carrying out additive data aggregation in a privacy-preserving manner for application in WSNs. The scheme has been quite popular and well-known. In spite of the popularity of this protocol, it has been found that the protocol is vulnerable to attack and it is also not energy-efficient. In this paper, we first present a brief state of the art survey on the current privacy-preserving data aggregation protocols for WSNS. Then we describe the CPDA protocol and identify its security vulnerability.

For privacy-preserving data aggregation in WSNs, He et al. (INFOCOM 2007) have proposed a Cluster-based Private Data Aggregation (CPDA) that uses a clustering protocol and a well-known key distribution scheme for computing an additive aggregation function in a privacy-preserving manner. In spite of the wide popularity of CPDA, it has been observed that the protocol is not secure and it is also possible to enhance its efficiency. In this paper, we first identify a security vulnerability in the existing CPDA scheme, wherein we show how a malicious participant node can launch an attack on the privacy protocol so as to get access to the private data of its neighboring sensor nodes. Next it is shown how the existing CPDA scheme can be made more efficient by suitable modification of the protocol.

We prove vastly improved bounds for the game theoretic algorithm. In doing so, we achieve the first distributed constant factor approximation algorithm for capacity maximization for the uniform power assignment. When compared to the optimum where links may use an arbitrary power assignment, we prove a $O(\log \Delta)$ approximation, where $\Delta$ is the ratio between the largest and the smallest link in the network. This is an exponential improvement of the approximation factor compared to existing results for distributed algorithms. All our results work for links located in any metric space.

2509.06898v1,BatStation: Toward In-Situ Radar Sensing on 5G Base Stations with  Zero-Shot Template Generation,Zhihui Gao; Zhecun Liu; Tingjun Chen,"The coexistence between incumbent radar signals and commercial 5G signals necessitates a versatile and ubiquitous radar sensing for efficient and adaptive spectrum sharing. In this context, leveraging the densely deployed 5G base stations (BS) for radar sensing is particularly promising, offering both wide coverage and immediate feedback to 5G scheduling. However, the targeting radar signals are superimposed with concurrent 5G uplink transmissions received by the BS, and practical deployment also demands a lightweight, portable radar sensing model. This paper presents BatStation, a lightweight, in-situ radar sensing framework seamlessly integrated into 5G BSs. BatStation leverages uplink resource grids to extract radar signals through three key components: (i) radar signal separation to cancel concurrent 5G transmissions and reveal the radar signals, (ii) resource grid reshaping to align time-frequency resolution with radar pulse characteristics, and (iii) zero-shot template correlation based on a portable model trained purely on synthetic data that supports detection, classification, and localization of radar pulses without fine-tuning using experimental data. We implement BatStation on a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed and evaluate its performance with real 5G traffic in the CBRS band. Results show robust performance across diverse radar types, achieving detection probabilities of 97.02% (PUCCH) and 79.23% (PUSCH), classification accuracy up to 97.00%, and median localization errors of 2.68-6.20 MHz (frequency) and 24.6-32.4 microseconds (time).

2307.13160v3,Static Posterior Inference of Bayesian Probabilistic Programming via  Polynomial Solving,Peixin Wang; Tengshun Yang; Hongfei Fu; Guanyan Li; C. -H. Luke Ong,"In Bayesian probabilistic programming, a central problem is to estimate the normalised posterior distribution (NPD) of a probabilistic program with conditioning via score (a.k.a. observe) statements. Most previous approaches address this problem by Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational inference, and therefore could not generate guaranteed outcomes within a finite time limit. Moreover, existing methods for exact inference either impose syntactic restrictions or cannot guarantee successful inference in general.  In this work, we propose a novel automated approach to derive guaranteed bounds for NPD via polynomial solving. We first establish a fixed-point theorem for the wide class of score-at-end Bayesian probabilistic programs that terminate almost-surely and have a single bounded score statement at program termination. Then, we propose a multiplicative variant of Optional Stopping Theorem (OST) to address score-recursive Bayesian programs where score statements with weights greater than one could appear inside a loop. Finally, we use polynomial solving to implement our fixed-point theorem and OST variant. To improve the accuracy of the polynomial solving, we further propose a truncation operation and the synthesis of multiple bounds over various program inputs. Our approach can handle Bayesian probabilistic programs with unbounded while loops and continuous distributions with infinite supports. Experiments over a wide range of benchmarks show that compared with the most relevant approach (Beutner et al., PLDI 2022) for guaranteed NPD analysis via recursion unrolling, our approach is more time efficient and derives comparable or even tighter NPD bounds. Furthermore, our approach can handle score-recursive programs which previous approaches could not.",2023-07-24,2024-08-01,cs.PL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13160v3,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13160v3,,,PLDI,2024,cs.PL,2025-09-09T07:39:04.346802

To fill in the gap, we provide the first differentiable quantum programming framework with unbounded loops, including a newly designed differentiation rule, code transformation, and their correctness proof. Technically, we introduce a randomized estimator for derivatives to deal with the infinite sum in the differentiation of unbounded loops, whose applicability in classical and probabilistic programming is also discussed.

The reachability problem for finite-state programs under PS 2.0 with only release-acquire accesses is already known to be undecidable. Therefore, we address, in this paper, the reachability problem for programs running under PS 2.0 with relaxed accesses together with promises. We show that this problem is undecidable even in the case where the input program has finite state. Given this undecidability result, we consider the fragment of PS 2.0 with only relaxed accesses allowing bounded number of promises. We show that under this restriction, the reachability is decidable, albeit very expensive: it is non-primitive recursive. Given this high complexity with bounded number of promises and the undecidability result for the RA fragment of PS 2.0, we consider a bounded version of the reachability problem. To this end, we bound both the number of promises and the ""view-switches"", i.e, the number of times the processes may switch their local views of the global memory. We provide a code-to-code translation from an input program under PS 2.0, with relaxed and release-acquire memory accesses along with promises, to a program under SC. This leads to a reduction of the bounded reachability problem under PS 2.0 to the bounded context-switching problem under SC.

Yavuz; Siddhartha Jayanti; Stephanie Balzer; Guy Blelloch,"In the past decade, many techniques have been developed to prove linearizability, the gold standard of correctness for concurrent data structures. Intuitively, linearizability requires that every operation on a concurrent data structure appears to take place instantaneously, even when interleaved with other operations. Most recently, Jayanti et al. presented the first sound and complete ""forward reasoning"" technique for proving linearizability that relates the behavior of a concurrent data structure to a reference atomic data structure as time moves forward. This technique can be used to produce machine-checked proofs of linearizability in TLA+. However, while Jayanti et al.'s approach is shown to be sound and complete, a mechanization of this important metatheoretic result is still outstanding. As a result, it is not possible to produce verified end-to-end proofs of linearizability. To reduce the size of this trusted computing base, we formalize this forward reasoning technique and mechanize proofs of its soundness and completeness in Rocq.

2509.06845v1,MIO: Multiverse Debugging in the Face of Input/Output -- Extended  Version with Additional Appendices,Tom Lauwaerts; Maarten Steevens; Christophe Scholliers,"Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously challenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent execution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it easier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore all potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward and backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any previously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution paths within the state space.  Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using existing multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e. states which are not encountered during regular execution. This can significantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend substantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse, may mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is caused by the debugger.  This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can accommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the semantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring that despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the debugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during regular execution.  We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino WebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our techniques.

2509.06794v1,Dato: A Task-Based Programming Model for Dataflow Accelerators,Shihan Fang; Hongzheng Chen; Niansong Zhang; Jiajie Li; Han Meng; Adrian Liu; Zhiru Zhang,"Recent deep learning workloads increasingly push computational demand beyond what current memory systems can sustain, with many kernels stalling on data movement rather than computation. While modern dataflow accelerators incorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations, existing programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively. Low-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant development overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away communication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to reconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded, task-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data communication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write programs as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded inputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually onto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a physical mapping that respects hardware constraints.

Ben-Amram; Samir Genaim; JoÃ«l Ouaknine; James Worrell,"This Survey provides an overview of techniques in termination analysis for programs with numerical variables and transitions defined by linear constraints. This subarea of program analysis is challenging due to the existence of undecidable problems, and this Survey systematically explores approaches that mitigate this inherent difficulty. These include foundational decidability results, the use of ranking functions, and disjunctive well-founded transition invariants. The Survey also discusses non-termination witnesses, used to prove that a program will not halt. We examine the algorithmic and complexity aspects of these methods, showing how different approaches offer a trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. The Survey does not discuss how termination analysis is performed on real-world programming languages, nor does it consider more expressive abstract models that include non-linear arithmetic, probabilistic choice, or term rewriting systems.",2025-09-08,2025-09-08,"cs.PL, cs.LO",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06752v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06752v1,,,PLDI,2024,cs.PL,2025-09-09T07:39:07.856728
2509.06724v1,Pacing Types: Safe Monitoring of Asynchronous Streams,Florian Kohn; Arthur Correnson; Jan Baumeister; Bernd Finkbeiner,"Stream-based monitoring is a real-time safety assurance mechanism for complex cyber-physical systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles. In this context, a monitor aggregates streams of input data from sensors and other sources to give real-time statistics and assessments of the system's health. Since monitors are safety-critical components, it is crucial to ensure that they are free of potential runtime errors. One of the central challenges in designing reliable stream-based monitors is to deal with the asynchronous nature of data streams: in concrete applications, the different sensors being monitored produce values at different speeds, and it is the monitor's responsibility to correctly react to the asynchronous arrival of different streams of values. To ease this process, modern frameworks for stream-based monitoring such as RTLola feature an expressive specification language that allows to finely specify data synchronization policies. While this feature dramatically simplifies the design of monitors, it can also lead to subtle runtime errors. To mitigate this issue, this paper presents pacing types, a novel type system implemented in RTLola to ensure that monitors for asynchronous streams are well-behaved at runtime. We formalize the essence of pacing types for a core fragment of RTLola, and present a soundness proof of the pacing type system using a new logical relation.",2025-09-08,2025-09-08,cs.PL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06724v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06724v1,,,PLDI,2024,cs.PL,2025-09-09T07:39:07.856753

In this article, we will consider possible answers to those questions by first analysing the history of the EXPRESS/SOS workshops and the data concerning the authors and the presentations featured in the editions of those workshops as well as their subject matters.  The results of our quantitative and qualitative analyses all indicate a diminishing interest in the theory of SOS as a field of research.

2010.15030v5,Actris 2.0: Asynchronous Session-Type Based Reasoning in Separation  Logic,Jonas Kastberg Hinrichsen; Jesper Bengtson; Robbert Krebbers,"Message passing is a useful abstraction for implementing concurrent programs. For real-world systems, however, it is often combined with other programming and concurrency paradigms, such as higher-order functions, mutable state, shared-memory concurrency, and locks. We present Actris: a logic for proving functional correctness of programs that use a combination of the aforementioned features. Actris combines the power of modern concurrent separation logics with a first-class protocol mechanism -- based on session types -- for reasoning about message passing in the presence of other concurrency paradigms. We show that Actris provides a suitable level of abstraction by proving functional correctness of a variety of examples, including a channel-based merge sort, a channel-based load-balancing mapper, and a variant of the map-reduce model, using concise specifications. While Actris was already presented in a conference paper (POPL'20), this paper expands the prior presentation significantly. Moreover, it extends Actris to Actris 2.0 with a notion of subprotocols -- based on session-type subtyping -- that permits additional flexibility when composing channel endpoints, and that takes full advantage of the asynchronous semantics of message passing in Actris. Soundness of Actris 2.0 is proven using a model of its protocol mechanism in the Iris framework.

The latter provides a novel model that is much closer to common developers' understanding of persistency semantics. We further introduce a simpler and stronger sequentially consistent persistency model, develop a sound mapping from this model to x86, and establish a data-race-freedom guarantee providing programmers with a safe programming discipline. Our operational models are accompanied with equivalent declarative formulations, which facilitate our formal arguments, and may prove useful for program verification under x86 persistency.",2020-10-26,2020-10-27,"cs.PL, cs.DC",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13593v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13593v2,,,POPL,2024,cs.PL,2025-09-09T07:39:15.049191

1610.08843v3,Fencing off Go: Liveness and Safety for Channel-based Programming  (extended version),Julien Lange; Nicholas Ng; Bernardo Toninho; Nobuko Yoshida,"Go is a production-level statically typed programming language whose design features explicit message-passing primitives and lightweight threads, enabling (and encouraging) programmers to develop concurrent systems where components interact through communication more so than by lock-based shared memory concurrency. Go can only detect global deadlocks at runtime, but provides no compile-time protection against all too common communication mismatches or partial deadlocks. This work develops a static verification framework for liveness and safety in Go programs, able to detect communication errors and partial deadlocks in a general class of realistic concurrent programs, including those with dynamic channel creation, unbounded thread creation and recursion. Our approach infers from a Go program a faithful representation of its communication patterns as a behavioural type. By checking a syntactic restriction on channel usage, dubbed fencing, we ensure that programs are made up of finitely many different communication patterns that may be repeated infinitely many times. This restriction allows us to implement procedures to check for liveness and safety in types which in turn approximates liveness and safety in Go programs. We have implemented a type inference and liveness and safety checks in a tool-chain and tested it against publicly available Go programs.

Naumann; Julien Signoles; Ãric Totel; FrÃ©dÃ©ric Tronel,"We show how static analysis for secure information flow can be expressed and proved correct entirely within the framework of abstract interpretation. The key idea is to define a Galois connection that directly approximates the hyperproperty of interest. To enable use of such Galois connections, we introduce a fixpoint characterisation of hypercollecting semantics, i.e. a ""set of set"" transformer. This makes it possible to systematically derive static analyses for hyperproperties entirely within the calculational framework of abstract interpretation. We evaluate this technique by deriving example static analyses. For qualitative information flow, we derive a dependence analysis similar to the logic of Amtoft and Banerjee (SAS'04) and the type system of Hunt and Sands (POPL'06). For quantitative information flow, we derive a novel cardinality analysis that bounds the leakage conveyed by a program instead of simply deciding whether it exists. This encompasses problems that are hypersafety but not k-safety. We put the framework to use and introduce variations that achieve precision rivalling the most recent and precise static analyses for information flow.",2016-08-04,2016-11-07,"cs.PL, cs.CR, D.2.4; D.3; F.3.1",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01654v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01654v2,10.1145/3009837.3009889,,POPL,2024,cs.PL,2025-09-09T07:39:15.049278
1501.02633v1,Very Static Enforcement of Dynamic Policies,Bart van Delft; Sebastian Hunt; David Sands,"Security policies are naturally dynamic. Reflecting this, there has been a growing interest in studying information-flow properties which change during program execution, including concepts such as declassification, revocation, and role-change.  A static verification of a dynamic information flow policy, from a semantic perspective, should only need to concern itself with two things: 1) the dependencies between data in a program, and 2) whether those dependencies are consistent with the intended flow policies as they change over time. In this paper we provide a formal ground for this intuition. We present a straightforward extension to the principal flow-sensitive type system introduced by Hunt and Sands (POPL '06, ESOP '11) to infer both end-to-end dependencies and dependencies at intermediate points in a program. This allows typings to be applied to verification of both static and dynamic policies. Our extension preserves the principal type system's distinguishing feature, that type inference is independent of the policy to be enforced: a single, generic dependency analysis (typing) can be used to verify many different dynamic policies of a given program, thus achieving a clean separation between (1) and (2).  We also make contributions to the foundations of dynamic information flow. Arguably, the most compelling semantic definitions for dynamic security conditions in the literature are phrased in the so-called knowledge-based style. We contribute a new definition of knowledge-based termination insensitive security for dynamic policies. We show that the new definition avoids anomalies of previous definitions and enjoys a simple and useful characterisation as a two-run style property.",2015-01-12,2015-01-12,"cs.CR, cs.PL",http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.02633v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02633v1,,,POPL,2024,cs.PL,2025-09-09T07:39:15.049307

Yavuz; Siddhartha Jayanti; Stephanie Balzer; Guy Blelloch,"In the past decade, many techniques have been developed to prove linearizability, the gold standard of correctness for concurrent data structures. Intuitively, linearizability requires that every operation on a concurrent data structure appears to take place instantaneously, even when interleaved with other operations. Most recently, Jayanti et al. presented the first sound and complete ""forward reasoning"" technique for proving linearizability that relates the behavior of a concurrent data structure to a reference atomic data structure as time moves forward. This technique can be used to produce machine-checked proofs of linearizability in TLA+. However, while Jayanti et al.'s approach is shown to be sound and complete, a mechanization of this important metatheoretic result is still outstanding. As a result, it is not possible to produce verified end-to-end proofs of linearizability. To reduce the size of this trusted computing base, we formalize this forward reasoning technique and mechanize proofs of its soundness and completeness in Rocq. As a case study, we use the approach to produce a verified end-to-end proof of linearizability for a simple concurrent register.",2025-09-08,2025-09-08,cs.PL,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06872v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06872v1,,,POPL,2024,cs.PL,2025-09-09T07:39:18.288930
2509.06845v1,MIO: Multiverse Debugging in the Face of Input/Output -- Extended  Version with Additional Appendices,Tom Lauwaerts; Maarten Steevens; Christophe Scholliers,"Debugging non-deterministic programs on microcontrollers is notoriously challenging, especially when bugs manifest in unpredictable, input-dependent execution paths. A recent approach, called multiverse debugging, makes it easier to debug non-deterministic programs by allowing programmers to explore all potential execution paths. Current multiverse debuggers enable both forward and backward traversal of program paths, and some facilitate jumping to any previously visited states, potentially branching into alternative execution paths within the state space.  Unfortunately, debugging programs that involve input/output operations using existing multiverse debuggers can reveal inaccessible program states, i.e. states which are not encountered during regular execution. This can significantly hinder the debugging process, as the programmer may spend substantial time exploring and examining inaccessible program states, or worse, may mistakenly assume a bug is present in the code, when in fact, the issue is caused by the debugger.  This paper presents a novel approach to multiverse debugging, which can accommodate a broad spectrum of input/output operations. We provide the semantics of our approach and prove the correctness of our debugger, ensuring that despite having support for a wide range of input/output operations the debugger will only explore those program states which can be reached during regular execution.  We have developed a prototype, called MIO, leveraging the WARDuino WebAssembly virtual machine to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of our techniques.

While modern dataflow accelerators incorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations, existing programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively. Low-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant development overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away communication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to reconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded, task-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data communication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write programs as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded inputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually onto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a physical mapping that respects hardware constraints. Experimental results on both AMD Ryzen AI NPU and Alveo FPGA devices demonstrate that Dato achieves high performance while significantly reducing the burden of writing optimized code.

Reproducibility and replicability of research results have gained a lot of interest recently with assessment studies being led in various fields, and they are often seen as a trigger for better result diffusion and transparency. In this work, we assess replicability in Computer Graphics, by evaluating whether the code is available and whether it works properly.

Black,"Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom.

Nonato,"Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges, visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while separate ones are useful in particular cases.",2025-09-07,2025-09-07,"cs.LG, cs.GR",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06167v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06167v1,,,Eurographics,2024,cs.GR,2025-09-09T07:39:39.472162
2509.05855v1,Programming tension in 3D printed networks inspired by spiderwebs,Thijs Masmeijer; Caleb Swain; Jeff Hill; Ed Habtour,"Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity, architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance. These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v) automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3 MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact, integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting structures in medical braces and splints.",2025-09-06,2025-09-06,"cs.GR, cs.RO",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05855v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05855v1,,,Eurographics,2024,cs.GR,2025-09-09T07:39:39.472188

However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit a few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation, a major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation. Second, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need to perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of sharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can take minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in practice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh optimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel re-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and intersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles; (2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free guarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the simplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by re-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm demonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k triangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090.

2509.05285v1,Improved 3D Scene Stylization via Text-Guided Generative Image Editing  with Region-Based Control,Haruo Fujiwara; Yusuke Mukuta; Tatsuya Harada,"Recent advances in text-driven 3D scene editing and stylization, which leverage the powerful capabilities of 2D generative models, have demonstrated promising outcomes. However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality stylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style consistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic correspondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we introduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while maintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style transfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D representation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views. Therefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized multi-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned depth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared attention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism, which effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally, inspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth maps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among stylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced Wasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image regions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that this optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables the mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene. Experimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that our pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization.",2025-09-04,2025-09-04,"cs.GR, cs.CV",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05285v1,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05285v1,,,Eurographics,2024,cs.GR,2025-09-09T07:39:39.472241

The Cosserat rod is a non-linear elastic rod with an oriented centreline, which enables modelling of bending, stretching and twisting deformations. It can be used for physically-based computer simulation of threads, wires, ropes, as well as flexible surgical instruments such as catheters, guidewires or sutures. We present a massively-parallel implementation of the original CoRdE model as well as our inextensible variation. By superseding the CUDA Scalable Programming Model and using inter-block synchronization, we managed to simulate multiple physics time-steps per single kernel launch utilizing all the GPU's streaming multiprocessors. Under some constraints, this results in nearly constant computation time, regardless of the number of Cosserat elements simulated. When executing 10 time-steps per single kernel launch, our implementation of the original, extensible CoRdE was x40.0 faster. In a number of tests, the GPU implementation of our inextensible CoRdE modification achieved an average speed-up of x15.11 over the corresponding CPU version.

2509.04145v2,Hyper Diffusion Avatars: Dynamic Human Avatar Generation using Network  Weight Space Diffusion,Dongliang Cao; Guoxing Sun; Marc Habermann; Florian Bernard,"Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars. However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale, cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.",2025-09-04,2025-09-08,"cs.GR, cs.CV",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04145v2,http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04145v2,,,Eurographics,2024,cs.GR,2025-09-09T07:39:39.472291
